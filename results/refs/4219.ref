Ben Affleck has revealed name of the slave-owning ancestor which he got PBS to cut from Finding My Roots .
He says his Freedom Rider mother Chris Anne was descended from Benjamin Cole , a Georgia slave-owner ` about six generations ' ago .
Oscar winner apologized last night for having PBS show cut revelation of his slave-owning roots , which was first revealed last week by Daily Mail Online .
` I did n't want any television show about my family to include a guy who owned slaves .
I was embarrassed , ' he wrote on Facebook .
PBS has launched an internal investigation into whether or not Finding Your Roots violated their editorial standards and its host 's future is in doubt .
