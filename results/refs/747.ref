ASU linebacker Davon Durant , 19 , was arrested last month after he allegedly hit his girlfriend of 18 months in the face and choked her .
Kelsi Langley , 19 , posted his bail and recanted her story to police the next day .
Witness called 911 on the day of alleged attack saying he had seen a man hit a woman in a car .
Durant pleaded not guilty to aggravated assault and disorderly conduct , and has been suspended indefinitely from the team .
Langley later claimed she got angry with Durant and lied to police .
Said finger marks on her neck were hickeys and her eyes were red from crying , not bruised .
The female ASU student and a civil rights activist accused police of making Durant out to be a thug .
