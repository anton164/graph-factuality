Floyd Mayweather is brash , he can be crass , and when it comes to being a braggart , he is the undisputed world champion .
Previously known as Money Mayweather , he took to referring to himself as TBE , or The Best Ever in the build-up to his fight with Manny Pacquiao .
He said this week he is better than Muhammad Ali and Sugar Ray Robinson ever were .
He is scorned as a great vulgarian and yet more than any other modern fighter he embodies the mastery of some of its finest skills .
You might want him to lose to Manny Pacquiao but you better accept that he probably wo n't .
He is as close to genius as it gets in modern boxing .
