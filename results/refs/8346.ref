Belle Gibson was awarded Cosmo 's Fun Fearless Female Award last year .
Bronwyn McCahon wishes her magazine had better investigated Ms Gibson .
Despite her cancer lies , Cosmo wo n't strip Gibson of the prize .
` What she does n't need now is the whole of Australia ganging up on her and bullying her , ' McCahon says .
