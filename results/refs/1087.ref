Heather Hironimus and the boy 's father , Dennis Nebus , have been warring since her pregnancy .
They were never married but share custody of their 4-year-old child .
In a parenting agreement filed in court , the two agreed to the boy 's circumcision .
Hironimus later changed her mind , giving way to a long court battle .
She filed a federal civil rights complaint late Monday .
It repeats the claims that surgery on her 4-year-old son is n't necessary , that the boy does n't want it , and that his constitutional rights are being violated .
Hironimus is also trying to avoid her own arrest .
The arrest was ordered after she fled in February and ignored a judge 's demand that she appear in court and allow the surgery to go forward .
