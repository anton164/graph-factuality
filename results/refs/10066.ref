Memphis Depay held a secret meeting Manchester United recently .
The Holland winger scored last week as PSV clinched the Eredivisie title .
Depay is Eredivisie 's top goalscorer with 20 - even though he is a winger .
Louis van Gaal previously admitted he lacks a 20-goals-per-season striker .
The 21-year-old is a left winger who cuts inside with a powerful right foot .
Nobody in Eredivisie completed more dribbles -LRB- 101 -RRB- last season than him .
In 2014 , Depay became the youngest-ever Dutch scorer at a World Cup .
