Wildlife photographer Einar Gudmann caught the violent encounter on camera while he was camping in Iceland .
After emerging into bitter sub-zero temperatures from his tent he spotted a female and male fox copulating .
But the pair were n't alone - a third Arctic fox lurked nearby and wasted no time in battling his rival for the female .
The losing fox was seen by the photographer limping off up a snowy hill and was n't expected to last the night .
