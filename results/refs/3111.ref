Anthony Corrales claims he was driving with his wife and daughter last June near a casino in New York City when a car cut in front of him .
Corrales claims he got out to write down the car 's license plate number , and was then mowed down and driven for several blocks on the hood .
The driver of that car , Robert Muller , was let off by police while Corrales was charged with harassment and breaking the windshield .
Muller claimed it was Corrales who jumped on the hood of his car after telling him ; ` Get out of the car tough guy ' Video footage from the casino shows Corrales on the car hood while Muller drives with his wife and daughter in the car .
` Instead of deterring Mr. Muller from future dangerous acts of road rage , the police ensured that he can continue to use his car as a weapon with impunity , ' said Corrales ' lawyer Leo Glickman .
