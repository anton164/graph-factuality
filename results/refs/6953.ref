Katie and Dalton Prager , 24 and 23 , met in 2009 and married two years later .
They both suffer from cystic fibrosis , and in November 2014 , Dalton received new lungs .
Katie is still waiting for a lung transplant because insurance company will not pay for the out-of-state treatment she needs , husband says .
Doctors predict she will not live a year without new lungs .
` They are turning my wife into a number , a statistic , a dollar sign .
I can not lose her .
This ca n't be the end of our love story , ' Dalton pleaded .
