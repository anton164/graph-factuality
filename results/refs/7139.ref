Khloe Kardashian posted a photo to Instagram during Monday night 's riots that said : ` Pray for Baltimore ' Despite getting over 400,000 likes , the post drew criticism that she was insincere and unable to relate to the issues due to her privileged background .
Other critics felt she should focus her prayers elsewhere , such as the victims of the Nepal earthquake .
Just 30 minutes later she tweeted that she was : ` Damned if I do .
Damned if I do n't ' , and asked : ` Now it 's wrong to pray ? '
The Instagram post has since been deleted .
