Nasa scientists in California have revealed a distant image of Curiosity taken by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter .
It was taken from an altitude of 187 miles -LRB- 300 km -RRB- up , revealing where the rover is heading towards .
One interesting aspect is that the rover 's tracks can not be seen behind it in the image .
This may be due to Martian weather or that they are the same colour as the surrounding surface .
