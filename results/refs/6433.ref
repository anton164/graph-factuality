Shelley Dufresne was arrested in September when a student at the high school she taught at started bragging about sleeping with two teachers .
It was later revealed that the 16-year-old had sex with both Dufresne and his former English teacher , 24-year-old Rachel Respess .
Dufresne , 32 , pleaded not guilty to charges in November , but changed course on Thursday when she admitted having sex with the teen .
In a forgiving plea deal , Dufresne will only have to attend a 90-day therapy program , stay away from the victim and turn in her teacher 's license .
In exchange , the charge of carnal knowledge of a child will be dropped after her probation and she wo n't have to register as a sex offender .
However , Dufresne is still awaiting an arraignment on charges for having a threesome with the same student and Respess in a different parish .
