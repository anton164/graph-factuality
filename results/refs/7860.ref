After the ` storm of a century ' finally dissipated last week , Sydneysiders believed the worst was over .
Then on Anzac Day large hailstones blanketed Sydney and the Blue Mountains in a ferocious downpour .
Hailstones of up to 2 cm were reported in some areas , as the storm transformed parts of the city into ` snowfields ' The weird weather conditions can be attributed to some degree to climate change , according to CSIRO .
Seven buildings , including five 200m long factories , collapsed under half a metre of hail in western Sydney .
State Emergency Services attended over 800 calls for help before the storm cleared at around 7 pm .
