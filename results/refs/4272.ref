James Weld had to stump up £ 15,000 to restore steps to the beach at Durdle Door which were washed away in 2012 .
Decision ends a three-year stand-off with Natural England over who was responsible for access to tourist attraction .
In 2009 , Natural England was handed responsibility for the country 's coastal paths under the Coastal Access Act .
But the government body claimed steps were n't part of coastal route and refused to pay for repairs for three years .
