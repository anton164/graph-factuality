Bethune-Cookman University student Damian Parks , 22 , drowned on Sunday .
He and four friends had gone swimming in Daytona Beach at 3 am after bar-hopping , Volusia County Beach Safety Ocean Rescue said .
Strong currents pulled Parks out to sea and his body was found on Monday .
Friends who were with him said there ` was no foul play at all ' and that Parks had not been drinking nor was he impaired in any way .
The five students were part of a step team called Melodic Stepping Experience , which formed last year .
Parks ' mother Carolyn Parks , who lost another son , aged 16 , six months ago , said that her son was not a good swimmer .
