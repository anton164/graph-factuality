Main problem was that the Bureau of Meteorology could not forecast exactly where the storm would form .
Storm was forecast to gather between Port Macquarie and Newcastle , but it formed just north of Newcastle .
It then covered 150 km south from Newcastle to Wollongong where a third of Australia 's population live .
When the storm hit it caused the maximum amount of destruction because of it being a huge suburban area .
Budget cuts also meant the Bureau of Meteorology did not have as many resources at its disposal .
` It 's just economics .
Weather balloons can now only be used in a limited number of places , ' says climate specialist .
Emergency services admitted on Tuesday they were shocked by the severity of the storm .
Their teams were overwhelmed by a weather system that changed very rapidly .
This weather system usually moves away after 12 hours but this one is going to stick around for 24-36 hours .
