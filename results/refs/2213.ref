Lillian Roldan says she dated Ariel Castro from 2000 to 2003 according to a new book about the Cleveland house of horrors by John Glatt .
Roldan says she met Castro on a blind date and that during their three-year relationship , he was nothing but a gentleman .
Two years into their relationship , Castro kidnapped his first two victims , Michelle Knight and Amanda Berry , and locked them in his basement .
Roldan says she never knew Castro was hiding the women , but that he did keep a padlock on his basement door .
Castro broke up with Roldan with a letter in October 2003 , and a few months later went on to kidnap his third victim Gina DeJesus .
The three women were kept captive in the house for another nine years , until they made a dramatic escape in May 2013 .
