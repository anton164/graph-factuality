Gate at Border Field State Park , California , was opened for selected families on Sunday in honor of Children 's Day .
It was only the second time it had been unlocked by Border Patrol Officers since it was put in place in mid-1990s .
Two young boys fell to their knees as they saw mom for first time in two years after she was deported to Mexico .
` We talked about how life was without our mom .
About how much we love each other , ' said one of boys , aged 10 .
Meanwhile , one grandmother wept as she embraced her seven-year-old granddaughter in front of photographers .
Many of the deported relatives had been living in US without documentation - and had not seen families for years .
They were given just minutes to hug and kiss their loved ones ; event was organised by non-profit Border Angels .
