The 11 teachers , testing coordinators and other administrators were convicted Wednesday of racketeering after a five-year investigation .
Evidence of cheating was found in 44 schools across the Atlanta school system , with nearly 180 educators involved .
A racketeering charge could carry up to 20 years in prison and most of the defendants will be sentenced on April 8 .
The cheating came to light after The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported in 2008 that some student 's scores were statistically improbable .
Prosecutors said the educators were guaranteed bonuses by inflating scores , while improving the poor reputation of their school system .
Superintendent Beverly Hall , the alleged ringleader who received up to $ 500,000 in payouts , died of breast cancer as the scandal went to trial .
One principal would wear gloves to erase answers and write in new ones .
