Joni Mitchell was hospitalized on Tuesday after being found unconscious in her California home .
Mitchell has suffered from Morgellons disease throughout her life , and has recently dedicated herself to trying to get it accepted as a medical condition .
Sufferers claim they feel the sensation of bugs or parasites constantly crawling under their skin and biting them .
They also say they are constantly itching , and large sore develop on their skin from which colorful fibers grow .
The medical community believes it is likely a mental illness and that sufferers are anxious , depressed or even suffering from substance abuse .
Mitchell , who has been a heavy smoker since she was 9-years-old and had polio as a child , has admitted she dealt with cocaine addiction in the 70s .
Individuals have said that taking antibiotics cured them of Morgellons , though some experts say it is simply a placebo effect .
