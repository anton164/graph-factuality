Willa Junior took a nap in the cargo hold of a plane at Seattle-Tacoma Airport on April 13 , and woke up after the flight to Los Angeles took off .
The baggage handler , who appears to be in his 20s according to Facebook , tried calling his company and 911 but his phone eventually failed .
He says he was afraid he might die , so he texted his mother a message , telling her ` I love you ' In a last ditch effort , Junior started banging on the ceiling of the cargo hold and his yells were so loud that passengers and crew heard .
The flight was turned around after just 14 minutes in the air and returned to Seattle where Junior was rescued .
Junior is still employed at his company , but is no longer allowed to work on Alaska Airlines flights - one the largest airlines that fly out of Seattle .
