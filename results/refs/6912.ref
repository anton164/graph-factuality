Marie Surprenant , from Atlanta , Georgia , was left paraplegic after being severely abused as an infant .
When Marie was eight-months-old she was admitted to the emergency room with more than 14 fractures , weighing only 14 lbs .
After social workers investigated her case , she was put into foster care and adopted by Michele Surprenant .
Michele , who is also a social worker , says it was her adoptive daughter 's idea to write the letter because she is grateful for her new home .
