Kefalonia is stunning and does n't play the Captain Corelli 's Mandolin card .
Island has n't been tainted by the crowds its Greek counterparts get .
It 's a quarter of the size of Spain 's Majorca but with a 20th of the tourists .
The one must-do outing in Kefalonia is to Fiskardo , a lovely harbour .
