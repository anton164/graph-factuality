Tracy Morgan was seen in public looking greatly improved as he walked with a cane on Monday , almost a year after his horrific auto accident .
The actor , who suffered a traumatic brain injury as well as a broken leg , a broken nose and broken ribs , was seen walking with a slight limp .
Morgan was accompanied by his fiancee Megan Wollover and their daughter Maven for a shopping trip in New Jersey .
This as his lawyer has revealed the actor may never return to ` the way he was ' as the extent of his brain injuries are still unknown .
Three of Morgan 's friends were injured and one , James McNair , was killed in the crash that occurred when their bus was rammed by a Wal-Mart truck .
The driver of the truck , Kevin Roper , is facing a criminal case in New Jersey , and Morgan has filed a lawsuit against Wal-Mart .
