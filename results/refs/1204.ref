Iowa-based writer Daniel P. Finney , 39 , weighed 563 lbs when he started sharing his weight loss journey a month ago in The Des Moines Register .
He knew it was time to shape up after X-rays found arthritis and a narrowing of his spinal cavity .
Daniel , who is already down 20 lbs , is attempting to lose the weight without surgery but is terrified to give up pizza and nachos .
