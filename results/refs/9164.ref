Washington , DC company United Space Structures wants to create a new space station .
It rotates four times a minute to create artificial gravity - with the ` stem ' and ` dome spinning in opposite directions .
It would be 1,300 ft -LRB- 400 metres -RRB- long , cost Â£ 200 billion -LRB- $ 300 billion -RRB- and take 30 years to build .
` We believe artificial gravity is required to support long term living in space , ' Bill Kemp from USS told MailOnline .
