Researchers studied 40 million posts made by 1.7 million web users .
From this they divided people into two groups - Future-Banned Users -LRB- FBUs -RRB- and Never-Banned Users -LRB- NBUs -RRB- .
They built an algorithm that scans posts for signs of antisocial behaviour .
Study shows this algorithm can identify potential trolls in 80 % of cases .
