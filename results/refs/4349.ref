Weinstein 's wife Georgina Chapman , 38 , is seeking to find a resolution to the allegations as soon as possible , according to one of the sources .
On Friday it emerged a sting set up by the NYPD shows Weinstein did n't deny touching Italian model Ambra Battilana - and apologized to her .
She alleges he asked her for a kiss and then groped her during a ` business meeting ' at his Manhattan office on Friday night .
A source claimed during the recorded conversation set up under the watch of the NYPD , he did not deny touching her .
The Hollywood producer has denied the allegations and has spoken to police , who have not filed charges .
But a spokesman for Chapman denied the marriage was in trouble and said they had spent the weekend together .
