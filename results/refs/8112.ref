The Rev. Robert H. Schuller died early Thursday at a care facility in Artesia , daughter Carol Schuller Milner said .
He and his late wife started a ministry in 1955 with $ 500 when he began preaching from the roof of a concession stand at a drive-in movie theater southeast of Los Angeles .
By 1961 , the church had a brick-and-mortar home -- a ` walk-in/drive-in church ' -- and Schuller began broadcasting the ` Hour of Power ' in 1970 .
In 1980 , he built the towering glass-and-steel Crystal Cathedral to house his booming TV ministry .
At its peak , in the 1990s , the program had 20 million viewers in about 180 countries .
