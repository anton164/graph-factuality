The gargoyles , endless balconies and fountains can be yours to help carry on the eccentric torch of quirky Indy celebrity Jerry A. Hostetler .
The current owner bought the home after Hostetler 's 2006 death .
He listed it for $ 2.2 M in February 2012 , $ 1.3 M in 2013 and now for less than a million .
The house is five garden-variety ranchers glued together to form a campus-o-fun complete with swimming pool , ballroom and guesthouse .
