Eight animals are dead , including at least one alligator that once belonged to Michael Jackson after a fire last week at an Oklahoma zoo .
The zoo 's founder , Joe Schreibvogel , said the fire was most likely set by rogue animal rights activists who have been targeting the zoo .
Schreibvogel : ` The building can be replaced ... Michael Jackson 's alligators can not be replaced '
