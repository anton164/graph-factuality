Police seized Rafi , 10 , and Dvora , 6 , in a Maryland park on Sunday and their parents say they were n't reunited by CPS for hours .
Scientists Danielle and Alexander Meitiv believe in ` free range parenting ' meaning the children are afforded total independence from infancy .
The Meitivs were found guilty of neglect in March .
After Sunday 's incident they were forced sign a paper pledging not to leave them unattended .
