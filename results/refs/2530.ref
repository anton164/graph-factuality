Michelle Carter , 18 , appeared in New Bedford court Thursday over the involuntary manslaughter of Conrad Roy II , 18 , who killed himself last July .
Carter ` sent Roy a series of texts encouraging him to take his own life ' Her lawyers claim she is ` bewildered at the charges ' and have asked for the case to be moved because the District Attorney is the victim 's third cousin .
They claim she was actually trying to help Roy .
Roy was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in his idling truck .
Carter told a friend she was worried that the police were checking his text messages , saying : ` I 'm done ... I could go to jail ' After he died , she raised money for suicide prevention and wrote on Twitter about how much she missed him .
Carter , who was 17 at the time , is free on bail but ca n't text or use social media .
