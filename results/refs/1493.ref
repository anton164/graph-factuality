Former District Judge G. Todd Baugh has been chosen for a lifetime achievement award by his local bar association .
Yellowstone Area Bar Association President Jessica Fehr said Thursday that Baugh was chosen for the award by the group 's board of directors .
Baugh , 73 , sparked widespread outrage in 2013 over comments suggesting that 14-year-old girl shared some responsibility for her rape by a teacher .
He sentenced Stacey Rambold to just one month in prison in the case .
At the sentencing , Baugh said 14-year-old Cherice Moralez was ` as much in control of the situation ' as Rambold .
He also described Moralez as ` older than her chronological age ' and called her a troubled youth .
Moralez killed herself before the case went to trial .
After prosecutors appealed , Rambold was re-sentenced in September and is serving 10 years in Montana State Prison .
He is appealing the sentence .
