Arizona police chief Terry Rozema has voiced his support for his officer after dashcam footage emerged .
Officer Michael Rapiejko is seen mounting a sidewalk in his speeding police car and knocking down armed suspect Mario Valencia .
Pozema argued that Rapiejko may actually have saved Valencia 's life because we do n't know what he would have done next .
` We do n't know that if -LRB- Rapiejko -RRB- lets him go for another 10 seconds , -LRB- Valencia -RRB- does n't take somebody out in the parking lot , ' Rozema said .
