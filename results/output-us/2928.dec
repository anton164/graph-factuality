Rubbish teams refused to empty a recycling bin because it had an empty crisp packet on its lid .
Binmen said the bag of Walkers prawn cocktail crisps fell foul of the rules -- even though it had been dropped there by a litterbug .
Else they left another bin full of rubbish because there was a scrap of cellophane on top .
Dozens of people have told waste collection squads as ` little Hitlers ' for enforcing recycling rules to the letter .
