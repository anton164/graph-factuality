 David Cameron made a visit to Poole in Dorset and sunny Bristol .
The PM was speaking in an almost empty science park on the city 's outskirts .
It was a glorious bank holiday , and the beach at Weston-super-Mare .
But Mr Cameron was appearing alongside George Osborne , Chancellor of the Exchequer .
