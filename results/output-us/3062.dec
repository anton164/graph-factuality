Archaeologists have discovered a previously unknown stretch of the Great Wall of China , thought to date back more than 2,000 years .
Experts say the new 6.2 mile-stretch means the full range of the Qin Dynasty Great Wall can be traced for the first time .
Nine sections of the Wall have been found over the last two months along the inner coast of the Yellow River in Gansu province and the Ningxia region .
