A new model for HIV progression shows that it spreads in a similar way to some computer ` worms .
They worked together to build a model for this ` hybrid spreading ' which accurately predicted patients ' progression from HIV to AIDS in a major clinical trial - and say early treatment is key to staving off AIDS .
The model predicts treatment should start as soon as possible after infection to prevent AIDS from developing .
