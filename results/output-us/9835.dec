A man tore a tendon in his thumb after playing Candy Crush on his phone for weeks and did n't even realise he was injured .
The 29-year-old had been playing the game all day for six to eight weeks as he had just left the military and was in between jobs .
He tore the tendon , an injury which is normally quite painful , but reported he felt nothing at all .
Doctors said his case shows video games can numb people 's pain and would need surgery to repair it
