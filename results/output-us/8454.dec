Millions of fake condoms sold by a gang across China have been seized by police after they were found to contain toxic metals .
Police in Shanghai revealed they had seized three million knock-off condoms - thought to be worth nearly Â£ 1.3 million on the black market - after they broke up a large operation covering eight provinces .
Officers said the lubricating oil used on the condoms at one production line in Henan province was so disgusting that it made them feel sick .
