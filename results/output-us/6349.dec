 England women 's Under 19 replay against Norway was a game only supposed to last for 18 seconds .
Leah Williamson held incredible nerve to retake a penalty which she ought to have taken on Saturday , were German referee Marjia Kurtes awarded a free-kick to Norway .
Kurtes disallowed her back to the spot awarded free-- awarded Norway .
England were given a lifeline when UEFA chiefs ruled it should be replayed .
