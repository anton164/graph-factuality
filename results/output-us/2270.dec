 unnamed worker was spotted on the roof 30-feet above the ground on top of an Edwardian semi-detached home in Greenwich .
A resident noticed the man carrying out the work with just a rope tied around him for safety .
A building expert said the workman should have at least had scaffolding up at the front of the property and a harness .
