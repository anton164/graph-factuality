Tons of rotting fish have filled a lagoon in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil where Olympic rowing and canoeing events will be held during next year 's Games .
Over the past week , thousands of the silver fish have died and have been scooped out of Rodrigo de Freitas lake , but city authorities and biologists have argued about the cause .
More than 37 tons of fish have been collected , according to Rio 's waste management company , but there is an overwhelming stench .
