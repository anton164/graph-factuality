 Asif Malik , 31 , his partner Sara Kiran , 29 , and their four children were caught on CCTV boarding a cross-Channel ferry from Dover earlier this month .
Thames Valley Police believed they arrived in Calais , France , before travelling south down through Europe in a bid to flee to Syria .
However a Turkish official claimed the couple had been arrested in Ankara and are currently in custody with four children .
Malik was pictured waving a flag in support of ISIS at a demonstration in London last year .
