 Palaeontologists in China say the impeccably preserved fossil belongs to a small dinosaur thought to have lived 160 million years ago .
The strange-looking creature had small stiff feathers on its body and long finger-like wings that were covered in a membrane like a bat 's wing .
Scientists believe the dinosaur may have named Yi qi , meaning ` strange wing ' may have glided or even flown through the air .
