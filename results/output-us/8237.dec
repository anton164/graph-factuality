 The family of a woman who battled a cancerous brain tumour for 14 years has claimed her diamond engagement ring was ` forcefully removed and stolen ' from her finger at a nursing home just days before she passed away .
Christine Davidson , from Adelaide , South Australia , was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer in 2001 , and told she only had nine months to three years to live .
The family has launched a desperate online appeal in a bid to have their mother 's ring returned .
