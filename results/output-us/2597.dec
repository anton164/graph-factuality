 Landon Carnie and his twin sister Lorie were initially thought to have died with scores of other youngsters when the first flight of Operation Babylift -- an evacuation of vulnerable Vietnamese orphans and children before the Fall of Saigon -- crashed minutes after take-off .
the 17-month-old twins were found huddled together in a rice paddy more than a day after the crash and later taken to their adoptive parents in the U.S. .
