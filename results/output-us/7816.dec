Birmingham Airport could soon be known as ` Shakespeare 's Airport ' in the U.S. in order to attract more visitors .
The concept was put forward after proving a success in attracting more people from China .
The airport could also be called ` Birmingham London ' as the HS2 rail link will make the hub just 38 minutes from the capital .
