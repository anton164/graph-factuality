Isis was removed from the official list of future Pacific hurricane names by the UN 's World Meteorological Organization .
The WMO Hurricane Committee deemed the name inappropriate because of the eponymous militant group .
As the name of an ancient goddess of Egypt , Isis had been on the WMO list of names for hurricanes in 2016 .
The Hurricane Committee also backed Mexico 's request to retire the name Odile and replace it with Ivette .
