 a survey of 1,000 people from across the country , conducted by personal budgeting software company YouNeedaBudget.com , 64 per cent of adults confessed that they end up spending more money when they shop with friends .
The main reasons for this were said to be ` showing off in front of friends and ` succumbing to peer pressure .
But nearly two-thirds of Americans admit they would prefer to shop by themselves than with pals .
