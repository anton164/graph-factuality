 Researchers in North Carolina claim that zapping the brain with a mild electric current can boost creativity by nearly eight per cent .
They tested their theory using a 10-Hertz current to stimulate the brain 's natural alpha wave oscillations .
As well as creativity , these oscillations - or the lack of them - are linked with depression .
