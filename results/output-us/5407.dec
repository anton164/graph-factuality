HSBC has apologised after a link on its official website directed visitors to a pornographic page .
Anyone trying to access the bank 's page for the Young Entrepreneur Awards was greeted by images of women posing naked or having sex .
The porn site took over the address after the awards were scrapped in 2011 and organisers allowed its registration on HSBC.com.hk to retire .
