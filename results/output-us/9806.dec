A two-mile Victorian railway line which was shut down 50 years ago could reopen as Britain 's longest cycle tunnel .
The disused Rhondda Tunnel , which runs 1,000 feet beneath the Welsh hills was closed as part of the Beeching cutbacks , a project .
But engineers are due to visit the 3,148 m tunnel next week - for the first time since it closed - to see whether it is safe to use as a cycle route .
