 Addison Russell , 21 , let his bat slip through his fingers in the seventh while he was trying to catch up to a fastball .
The bat went flying and struck a fan sitting several rows behind the Cubs ' on-deck circle in the face .
Cubs officials rushed to assist the spectator and towels from the home team 's dugout were brought to the fan .
