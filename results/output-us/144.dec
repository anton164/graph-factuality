Social media experts say they have found a connection between online traffic in downtown Baltimore on Monday and activity recorded during last year 's violent protests in Ferguson , Missouri .
A leading data mining firm claims between 20 and 50 social media accounts active in Baltimore were also used some 825 miles away in Ferguson during last summer 's violence .
The data suggests the presence of ` professional protesters ' or anarchists who are in Baltimore and are looking to take advantage of Freddie Gray 's death to Baltimore .
