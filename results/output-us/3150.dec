 a new militia of female jihadis firing machine guns and practising drills in Syria .
All of the women are fully veiled , making it hard to identify individuals but it is possible the group may be linked to Islamic State .
The radical women are shown shouting jihad slogans and attempting to use their AK 47 rifles .
The video is believed to have been filmed at the St Simeon 's Church .
