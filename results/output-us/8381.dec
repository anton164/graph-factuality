 Australia , an important ally of the United States , has agreed to share some of its intelligence with Iran .
Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop says the deal is `` an informal arrangement '' with an emphasis on tracking Australians who go to Iraq to fight for ISIS .
But one Australian lawmaker described the move as `` dancing with the devil .
The Bishop became the first Australian government minister to visit Iran in 12 years , meeting with President Hassan Rouhani .
