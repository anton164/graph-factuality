 Linda McLean was in her classroom at Pine Eagle Charter School in the tiny town of Halfway in August of that year when a masked man in a hoodie burst in with a gun , lowered it to her head and pulled the trigger .
The 56-year-old elementary school teacher had no clue it was a drill to test her ` preparedness ' or that the gun was loaded with blanks .
the shooter said she would soon die .
McLean is still traumatized by the event .
