 A Reddit thread is placing a clickable button next to a 60-second timer .
When The Button is clicked , the timer resets and no-one can resist clicking it .
It is not yet known what happens when the timer reaches zero and users can only click The Button once .
Only people who registered on r/thebutton thread on April Fool 's Day .
