A new video that was filmed by the creative agency Leo Burnett Toronto for the homeless charity Humans For Humans is designed to make people think twice about the way that they look at people who sleep rough .
Many of the people break down in tears as they read comments , ` I hate the homeless , I do n't feel sorry for you , .
and ` I saw a homeless girl across the street .
and and ` a homeless for homeless girl 's .
