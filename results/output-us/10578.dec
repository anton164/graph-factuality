 police discovered 20 grams of marijuana hidden within a leg of lamb in the Northern Territory .
It is believed the lamb had been shipped to a company at Darwin Airport , and would be sent on to the Tiwi Islands 100kms to the north .
The stash would have been worth $ 2000 if it had been sold , four times the normal price of the drug in Australia .
