Aaron Hernandez was booked at MCI Cedar Junction in Walpole , a prison just across the freeway from Gillette Stadium where he used to play for the New England Patriots .
Hernandez has n't set foot in the stadium since June 2013 , when he was arrested under suspicion of murdering Odin Lloyd .
On Wednesday a 12-person jury found Hernandez guilty , sentencing him to life in prison without the possibility of parole .
Hernandez is vowed to appeal the decision .
