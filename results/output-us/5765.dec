Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Australia got off to a dramatic start in Sydney on Sunday night , when the opening show was interrupted by a man who stormed the runway at the Ellery show .
As designer Kym Ellery made her way down the catwalk to take her bow , a furious man understood to be a neighbour of the Carriageworks venue made a public complaint about the music .
The man was reportedly overheard complaining that show organisers had ` no respect for the local community .
