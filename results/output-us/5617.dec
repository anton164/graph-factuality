 Astronomers say a white dwarf star - the dense core of a star like the Sun that has run out of nuclear fuel - ripped apart a planet at the edge of the Milky Way galaxy .
When a star reaches its white dwarf stage , nearly all of the material from the star is packed inside a radius one hundredth that of the planet .
For example , the gravity at the white dwarf is over ten thousand times higher than the surface of the Sun .
