 The FBI repeatedly deceived Congress by destroying vital files relating to the assassination of Martin Luther King .
Leading King historian Stuart Wexler said the bureau chose to cover up the potential role of a high level informant in the killing rather than tell the truth .
By destroying the files the FBI disobeyed a direct order not to do so from a Congressional Committee .
