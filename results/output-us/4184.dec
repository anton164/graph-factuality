Taken at the dawn of photography , these pictures are some of the first taken of the city of Bristol , nearly 100 years before much of its historic centre was destroyed by Nazi bombing .
The images , captured between 1850 and 1855 by photographer Hugh Owen have surfaced after being put up for auction - and could fetch up to Â£ 30,000 .
The buildings were made in the 1870s .
