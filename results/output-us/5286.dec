 Dove has the new One Beautiful Thought ad campaign , Dove asked a group of women to write down every thought they had about themselves .
The women filled in a notebook each , and handed it back to Dove .
Unbeknownst to the women , criticisms , negative remarks and self body-shaming were turned into a script .
Dove recruited two undercover actresses to read the script .
