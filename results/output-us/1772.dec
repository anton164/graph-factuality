France voted to punish anyone who ` incites ' people to become dangerously thin with prison and huge fines .
MPs particularly highlighted the irresponsibility of fashion websites which encourage women to keep their weight as low as possible .
Now these ` pro-anorexia ' sites will face a year in prison and a fine equivalent to just over Â£ 7,000 .
Around 40,000 people suffer from anorexia in France , women and teenage girls .
