Usain Bolt says Tyson Gay should have been given a longer ban for drugs cheating , and branded the decision to shorten his punishment ` the stupidest thing I 've ever heard .
Gay had his suspension reduced after he agreed to co-operate with authorities , and is now set to compete against Bolt after returning to the sport .
Bolt is the fastest man of all time and is returning to sport .
