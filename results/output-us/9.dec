 The Prevention of Terrorism Act - passed in the capital Kuala Lumpur yesterday - officially enables authorities to detain suspected terrorists for two years without charge or trial .
But it also allows the authorities to apply for unlimited extensions after those two years expire .
The bill effectively reintroduces the controversial prospect of indefinite detention without trial in Malaysia .
Malaysian police said 17 people with suspected links to the Islamic State terror group , or who had sought to travel to Syria or Iraq .
