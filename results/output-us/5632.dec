Inverness Cup hero Gary Warren has called for a change to the ` ridiculous ' rule that will see him banned from a second final in successive seasons .
Warren picked up his second booking of the competition in Sunday 's Scottish Cup semi-final win over Celtic -- meaning automatic suspension for the season finale on May 30 .
But the central defender says either the threshold should be raised should be wiped from the record for any final .
