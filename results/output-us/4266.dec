Hundreds of fishermen race to be rescued from an isolated Indonesian island where many were enslaved to catch seafood for Western restaurants .
More than 300 fishermen emerged from nearby trawlers , villages and even the jungle to make the trip , having been kept like slaves at the Pusaka Benjina Resources fishing company compound .
They were rescued by the Indonesian Fisheries Ministry after officials issued a moratorium on fishing to crack down on poaching .
