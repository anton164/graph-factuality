The 12-year-old daughter of the mailman who landed his gyrocopter on the lawn of the U.S. Capitol last week has said she was ` downright proud ' of her dad .
Her father , 61-year 61 Doug Hughes , landed the aircraft on the West Lawn last Wednesday to protest campaign finance laws but was swiftly taken into custody .
He is now under house arrest at their Ruskin , Florida home as he will go on trial for crossing a no-fly zone .
