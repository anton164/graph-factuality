 Kalman Kallai enjoyed the spectacular Canadian scenery from the comfort of a green chair while journeying from Borden , Ontario to Comox , British Columbia for work purposes .
Calculating that the drive would take him across 2,796 miles of land .
The traveller sits before corn , a caf√© , boats and water , before he 's adventure .
