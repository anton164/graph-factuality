 Prescott City Attorney Jon Paladini claims the fire 's sole survivor , lookout Brendan McDonough , heard the leader of the Granite Mountain Hotshots order the crew to leave a safe spot where the fire had burned .
The Yarnell Hill Fire killed 19 firefighters in 2013 , the worst disaster of its kind since 1933 .
New Paladough 's claim is based on what he says he was told by McDonini .
