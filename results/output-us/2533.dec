 The creatures were discovered at Blairgowrie Pier but are fast on the move to their proper migration at Rye Pier in a few weeks time .
Spider crabs migrate once a year in the Port Phillip Bay area in Southern Victoria .
The full migration is expected to occur in two to five weeks when the water temperature will drop to 14 degrees .
