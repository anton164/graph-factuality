 Should fast food and sugary drink companies be allowed to advertise their junk food to children ?
A recent survey by the British Heart Foundation showed two fifths of parents are badgered by their children each week to buy food after seeing it advertised on TV , prompting the charity to deliver a 30,000 strong petition asking the Government to ban junk food adverts being shown before the 9 pm watershed .
Seven in the UK are still being exposed to more TV advertising for unhealthy products .
