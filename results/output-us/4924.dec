Indiana has seen a ` significant increase ' in the number of cases of HIV more than two weeks into a short-term needle exchange program approved by Gov.
Mike Pence .
There are now 120 confirmed confirmed HIV cases and 10 preliminary positive cases tied to Scott County , about 30 miles north of Louisville , Kentucky .
But the growing number could put pressure on Pence to extend the 30-day needle exchange programs on March 26 .
Pence approved needle exchanges as an anti-drug policy .
