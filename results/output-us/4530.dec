 a study has claimed that we could create our own auroras , by firing a particle accelerator into the sky from space .
The intriguing research says that a beam fired from the machine would create artificial auroras -- and it could even create lightning in the atmosphere .
Scientists in California have described how to create auroras on Earth .
They particle accelerator could be sent 185 miles -LRB- 300 km -RRB- up into space .
It would then fire high-energy beams back at Earth 's
