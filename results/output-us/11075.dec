 Moses Yitzchok Greenfeld , 19 , from Stamford Hill , London , had been swimming with four friends as temperatures reached 25C when he got into difficulty .
An eyewitness has at least seven police officers stood on a bank and watched as the boys dived in and out looking for their friend .
It is thought Mr Greenfield may have had a cardiac arrest because of the shock of jumping into the water .
