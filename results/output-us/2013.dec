 Brazilian commuter Nelson Felippe was deeply offended by a scene he witnessed on a train platform .
He proceeded to take a photo , and express his disapproval on Facebook , after the image was shared more than 100,000 times in 24 hours .
In the image becomes clear in a post .
A man breaks safety regulations by standing with his foot on the yellow line .
The post is in homophobia .
