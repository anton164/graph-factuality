Comedian Rik Mayall failed to leave a valid will to deal with his Â£ 1.2 million estate , died aged 56 last June .
But probate records reveal he had no will -- even though he suffered serious head injuries and nearly died in a quad-bike accident in 1998 .
His estate could be liable for his wife of 29 years , Barbara , and their three adult children .
