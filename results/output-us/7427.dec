Carl Frampton has been offered a huge Â£ 1.5 million to face Scott Quigg in one of the biggest fights .
Talks between the super-bantamweight world champions have reached a standstill , but Quigg 's promoter , Eddie Hearn , attempted to jolt Frampton 's camp into a July 18 fight in Manchester by offering the biggest cheque of the Northern Irishman 's career .
The proposal was made live on television , with Frampton to accept the terms .
