 The so-called ` boomerang generation ' are placing their parents under serious financial pressure by living at home even in their twenties and thirties .
debt organisations have warned parents should not be afraid to ask their children for rent and money .
But as many as three-quarters of parents whose children are over 18 still have at least one child living with them .
80 per cent still buy their children 's groceries for them .
