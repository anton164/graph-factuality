 bride-to-be Adele McKenzie found the dress she had dreamed of wearing when she married her partner of nine years , David Elliot .
` I had dreamt about this princess dress since I was a little girl .
Ms McKenzie said she was n't able to buy the $ 2,000 dress outright so she organised a payment plan with ` The Bridal Centre .
She opened an email from the bridal company that they were going bankrupt .
