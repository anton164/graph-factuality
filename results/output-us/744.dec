Garnet was established in the 1860s by miners looking for gold and silver , but it was devastated by fire around 1912 and deserted .
It is said to be haunted by former residents , visitors saying they heard music and laughter , even in winter , and the sound of doors slamming in cottages .
Now the U.S. Bureau of Land Management is offering free food , housing a job to people willing to live in Garnet and work as a tour operator .
