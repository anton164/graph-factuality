 Patrick and Valerie Jubb are attempting to sell the four-bedroom property where they currently reside in Jimena de la Frontera , but it is now on the brink of being torn down .
The retired couple say they have done nothing wrong but face losing the estate over illegal additions made by a previous owner .
The Jubbs purchased the bed and breakfast in southern Spain , in 2008 .
