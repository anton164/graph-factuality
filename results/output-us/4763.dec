 Kimberley Donoghue , 28 , from Ponthenri , was forced to hobble down the aisle after breaking her leg and a bone in her foot just four days before her wedding .
Wearing the heavy white cast beneath her fairy tale dress , her father wheeled her into church and she sat down to say her vows .
She has decided to postpone the official wedding photographs until the plaster is off .
