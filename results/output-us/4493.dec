Tesco chairman John Allan claimed the Tory leader 's decision to promise an in-out referendum before knowing what powers can be clawed back from Brussels means the cart is very firmly before the horse .
He suggested large firms like the supermarket giant could move their head offices from London to other sites in Europe ` relatively painlessly ' should Britain exit the EU .
The Tory election manifesto includes the in- referendum referendum by 2017 , but only after reform of Britain 's membership .
