 Labour party will launch a billboard advert using the image from the famous 1979 ` Labour Is n't Working ' poster , but instead it will warn : ` The doctor ca n't see you now .
The poster features the same line of people used to illustrate dole queues under Jim Callaghan 's government .
It will also claim two million more patients are unhappy with doctors opening hours compared to the last election .
