A student at Columbia University , has launched a KickStarter campaign to fund her upcoming fashion line Epidemia Designs , she came up with after spending days upon days staring at cells through microscopes in her biology classes , and spotting an article on epidemics .
Using mirroring , Photoshop and kaleidoscope effects , each biological subject was turned into an eye-catching pattern .
The designs in the line include scarves printed with rabies , chicken pox and polio .
