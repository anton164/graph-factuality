 A video posted on Facebook captured motorists pulling over and getting out of their cars on Interstate 20 in Texas , to pick up cash that had spilled from a Brinks Armored Truck .
The passenger door of the truck somehow opened as it was moving causing a plastic bag with a ` substantial amount of money ' to be blown out .
Police have warned anyone caught with the money from the truck will be prosecuted .
