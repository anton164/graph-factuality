 Rose Devereux , 49 , was left in agony and disfigured after years of alleged incompetent treatment .
Pictures show her bottom row of teeth virtually destroyed by terrible gum disease and crowns covering a similar disaster on the top row .
She now faces a bill of Â£ 30,000 to get her smile back .
She also had all her lower teeth removed and needed bone grafts .
