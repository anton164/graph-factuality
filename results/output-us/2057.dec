 Patients at Wolfson Children 's Hospital are able to remotely play with animals at the Jacksonville Humane Society shelter .
The system uses high-definition cameras and interactive toys to let the children control three different cat toys at the shelter with the push of a button , and then watch on the TV as the animals react and play with them .
The Idaho firm has already installed its system in 10 animals shelters across the US , letting anyone play with cats .
