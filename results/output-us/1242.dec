Ed Miliband has dismissed claims he would be held to ransom by the SNP as Prime Minister .
The Labour leader insisted SNP MPs would not be able to dictate policy , even if he fails to win a majority and is reliant on them to stay in Number 10 .
It comes after the Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon this morning said Labour could only govern with the support of the SNP .
Ed Miliband rejected claims the SNP would be ` calling the shots ' if Labour did not have a majority .
