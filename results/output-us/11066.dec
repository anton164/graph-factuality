 Pippa Middleton has told of eating Minke whale -- even though it is largely banned worldwide .
She boasted of tucking into the delicacy in Norway , to the horror of environmental campaigners who say she is helping promote an ` unimaginably cruel ' trade .
Ms Middleton said she ate whale carpaccio in a ` convivial atmosphere at the Juvet Landscape Hotel .
The hunting and importation of whale meat is banned in Britain .
