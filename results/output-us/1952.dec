 The oil painting - which measures nine inches by seven - of a Catholic saint was believed to be the work of a ` follower ' of 16th century renaissance master El Greco .
But the selling price suggests the untitled , undated and unsigned painting may have been done by the artist himself .
Auctioneer Richard Bromell gave the tiny painting an estimated value of about £ 300 to £ 400 but it ended up selling for more than £ 120,000 .
