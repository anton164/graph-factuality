 Ethan Czahor has launched ` Clear ' which removes any posts that might cause you problems with your current or future employer .
Users can search for keywords such as ` gay ' , ` black ' or swear words and the program deletes any tweet that mentions them .
In February , Mr Czzor was fired from his job as a chief technology officer for Mr Bush , the former Florida governor and potential 2016 Presidential candidate .
