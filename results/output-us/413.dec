 Lance Corporal Riki Hughes has been jailed for 16 months after he plundered the accounts of Tidworth Town Football Club , where he volunteered as club secretary .
He claimed to be making rent payments to the club 's landlord - even though the team was getting property for free .
Hughes , 31 , spent the money on himself , including camping equipment and a stag holiday to Las Vegas .
