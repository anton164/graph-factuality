 More than 700 Asiatic black bears , over a third of those held in captivity in Vietnam , have allegedly been butchered in the past year alone -- with up to four bears inexplicably killed in one day on some farms .
Farmers claim the extinction-threatened bears are dying from disease and old age and owners are killing them to ` extract the last ounce of blood ' and selling their body parts to make Chinese medicine .
