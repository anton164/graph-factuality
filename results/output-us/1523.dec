Baudwell , 62 , claimed visitors to his 50-room Jacobean manor in Staffordshire have felt a bed vibrate and a ghost brushing past them on the stairs .
The businessman believes the ghostly goings-on are being caused by the spirit of a terrified little boy who died in the English Civil War .
Mr Caudwell says the room is where the boy died .
