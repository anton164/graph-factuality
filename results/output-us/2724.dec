More than a dozen areas in the US have been shaken by small earthquakes triggered by oil and gas drilling .
The man-made quakes jolted once stable regions in eight states , including parts of Alabama , Arkansas , Colorado , Kansas , New Mexico , Ohio , Oklahoma and Texas .
Earthquakes were sometimes caused by fracking , in which large volumes of water , sand and chemicals are pumped into rock formations .
Many studies have linked the rise in small quakes to the oil and man industry .
