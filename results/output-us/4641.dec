The Secret Service took more than a year to replace a broken alarm system at the home of George H. Bush .
The alarm failed at the former president 's Houston residence in September 2013 and it took until December for it to installed - leaving the couple without the working alarm at their home for 15 months .
The report says Bush had ` great respect ' for the Secret Service .
