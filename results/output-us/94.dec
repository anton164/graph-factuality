 Former Adelaide doctor Tareq Kamleh featured in the latest ISIS video propaganda video at the weekend wearing western-style surgical scrubs and handling babies in a maternity ward as he urged people to join the death cult notorious for beheading non-Muslims .
Despite his public support for ISIS , Dr Kamhh still remains registered to practice medicine in Australia until September 30 because the Medical Board has refused to deregister him .
