Ethel Rider , 87 , suffered a broken pelvis and was left ` cowering ' in pain after falling from her bed .
But her carers failed to seek medical help and simply lifted her back into bed .
Because she is mute , Mrs Rider was unable to tell anyone what had happened .
It was only 24 hours later that a nurse realised she was in agonising pain and called an ambulance .
