Volunteers who restored one of the Dunkirk ` Little Ships ' are now hoping they will be able to take the vessel back to the beaches where it helped to rescue 600 British soldiers .
Fire boat Massey Shaw was requisitioned from the London Fire Brigade in 1940 and transported to Dunkirk to help with the evacuation of Allied troops .
After carrying 600 soldiers back to Britain the boat helped to save St Paul 's Cathedral in the Blitz .
