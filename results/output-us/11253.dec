 Retired policeman Spencer Bell , 71 , had ventured on to the motorway near Watford , Hertfordshire after a man fell from a bridge in January last year .
But as he tended the victim -- Alan Tretheway , 67 -- Mr Bell was struck by a Toyota driven by mother-of-three Iram Shahzad .
She was sentenced to 14 months imprisonment , suspended for two years , and banned from driving for 18 months .
