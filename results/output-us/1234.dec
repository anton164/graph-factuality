 4 British holidaymakers were stranded overnight on an impounded cruise ship in Lisbon harbour after its owners were served with a summons for an allegedly unpaid debt .
The passengers coming towards the end of a 15 night cruise became the legal wrangle between a former crew member and the owners .
They were due to leave Lisbon for Bristol at 7 pm on Tuesday but lawyers slapped a court order on the ship .
The ship is operated by Cruise & Maritime Voyages .
