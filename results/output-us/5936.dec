A reporter for CBS filed a lawsuit against two of his bosses at the network this week , claiming one drunkenly groped and kissed him at a Christmas party and that the other aggressively came onto him during an after-hours meeting .
Kenneth Lombardi , who goes by Ken , was a red carpet regular for CBS New York , interviewing stars from Oprah to Ashton Kutcher and Arnold Schwarzenegger .
The first alleged encounter occurred at a CBS Christmas party in December 2013 .
