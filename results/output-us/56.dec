 Alison Hall , 48 , was at work when she felt her chest tightening and took out her blue salbutamol inhaler .
She took a sharp breath and felt something shoot to the back of her throat when she took a puff .
The mother-of-one ran outside in a panic when a neighbour began pounding her back before calling 999 .
She believes the nail may have worked its way inside the inhaler through a gap .
