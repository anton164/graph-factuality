Scientists have used cosmic rays from the distant universe to study lightning and thunderclouds .
But this experiment observed how cosmic rays were affected by lightning as they passed through it - providing information on the electrical field of a given storm .
Scientists in The Netherlands were using the Lofar radio telescope .
They found it could measure changes in lightning caused by cosmic rays .
A storm can have hundreds of millions of volts over multiple kilometres .
The experiment is conducted using the Low-Frequency Array telescope in the Netherlands
