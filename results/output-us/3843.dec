Wisconsin 's Frank Kaminsky has brushed off the obsenity and racial slur that Kentucky guard Andrew Harrison directed at him during a postgame news conference at the Final Four .
Harrison muttered ` F *** that n **** ' into a live microphone when another player was asked about Kaminsky after Kentucky lost 71-64 to the Badgers Saturday .
The loss ruined the Wildcats ' undefeated season ; they finished 38-1 .
Harrison has since apologized for his comment .
