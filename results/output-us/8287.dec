 Leah Rogers and Ryan Flanaghan were selling a range of toys at the boot sale in Bude , Cornwall , when they spotted the purple teddy at another seller 's stall .
As Mr Flanaghan , 22 , recognised the bear as a limited edition Princess Diana Di Beanie Baby - one of the most sought after in the collection .
The bear turned out to be one of just 100 made in December 1997 for the Princess of Wales Memorial Trust .
