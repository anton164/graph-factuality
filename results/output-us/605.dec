England suffered an injury scare at the start of their practice ` match ' here in St Kitts when Stuart Broad dramatically slipped in his delivery stride and was left clutching his ankle on the floor .
Broad had complained about the state of the crease after overnight rain , after bowling just three balls of his first over of the day at Warner Park .
Broad went off to receive ice treatment and returned to the action .
