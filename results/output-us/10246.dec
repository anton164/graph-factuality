 Fritz the Golden Retriever from California appears to lack any eye-mouth co-ordination skills , .
The pooch was filmed wearing bunny ears this Easter trying - and miserably failing - to catch a hard-boiled egg between his teeth .
However , the egg narrowly misses his jaw , bounces off his chest and hits the grass instead .
