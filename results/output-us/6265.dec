 Bogan Shire Council is aiming to erect in the town of Nyngan to honour the Aussie icon - and draw in the crowds .
Graeme Burke said the 3.6-metre statue would show a ` bloke ' wearing shorts , thongs and a singlet with a fishing rod and tuckerbox .
Locals and visitors would also be able to sit on it and take photographs .
