 Mohammed Tahir , 53 , of Leytonstone , east London , got off his train at Mile End and picked a target on the platform - a ` confident and articulate ' professional in her 20s , a court heard .
He then followed her onto a Central line service and stood as close to her as he could .
But Tahir moved his crotch and pot belly against her thigh and bottom .
He was convicted of sexual assault for five years .
