The song ca n't be identified and does n't fit the pattern of noise generated by the few known species of beaked whale , raising hopes that it could be coming from a completely new species .
There are 22 species of speciesaked whale and all of them are identified by their songs .
The Antarctic BW29 signal was recorded near the Orkney Islands , and Antarctic Peninsula .
