Prince George 's birth in 2013 sparked a £ 247m sales bonanza for makers of royal memorabilia .
A more modest sales increase of between £ 60 and £ 70m is predicted , with most of that spent on champagne and cake .
However the baby is expected to make more of an impact in the long term - especially if the child turns out to be a girl .
Prince Charles is hoping for items sold in his Highgrove shop .
