Former pub landlord Michael Thorpe says he has paid a heavy price for the lengthy fight to get his conviction quashed and has lost his pub as a result .
Mr Thorpe , 55 , was convicted of showing a Premier League game without having an agreement with official broadcasters in November 2006 at the Stoke Inn in Plymouth , Devon .
But he was convicted , fined and ordered to pay costs eight years ago , when screening the matches was still treated as a criminal offence .
