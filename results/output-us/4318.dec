 Teacher Aaron Galloway , 23 , was on a half-term city break to Prague when he left his expensive SLR camera on the seat as he landed in the Czech Republic capital .
Ground crew phoned the flight attendants within minutes but there was no sign of the Â£ 499 Nikon .
He went on eBay to find a replacement and admitted being a Ryanair flight attendant .
