 Gold Coast City Council will finally be able to shut down illegal party houses in suburban areas after the state government approved new planning powers .
There are more than 700 party houses across the city , which are often used for unruly weekend-long parties that distress and terrify neighbours .
Party houses are just short-term accommodation options that people regularly rent out for rowdy events .
