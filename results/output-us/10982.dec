The mass stranding of 160 melon-headed whales on two beaches in Japan has triggered fears of upcoming earthquake and tsunami .
The whales , which are in fact a species of dolphin , were found washed up along a 6-mile -LRB- 10 km -RRB- stretch of Tokyo .
The fears appeared based on the appearance of 50 melon whales six days before the devastating undersea earthquake in 2011 .
However scientists have dismissed the claims as being ` unscientific .
