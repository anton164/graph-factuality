Liverpool winger Raheem Sterling was allegedly pictured smoking a shisha pipe .
In a photograph revealed by the Sunday Mirror , the 20-year-old is seen taking a drag from the large orange pipe -- containing fruit-scented tobacco and smoked through hot coals via a tube .
Sterling recently snubbed a new Â£ 100,000-a-week contract at Anfield amid fears he could leave the club .
Sterling is said that one shisha session is equal to smoking around 200 cigarettes
