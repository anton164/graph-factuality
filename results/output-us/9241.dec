Pensioners and neighbours have criticised the Â£ 750,000 refurbishment of sheltered accommodation which has made it look like Legoland .
All of the 36 units at the Redlands House sheltered accommodation have been labelled an ` eyesore ' by local residents .
But the local council defended the colour scheme , claiming it will help residents with poor eyesight .
