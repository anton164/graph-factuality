 Anna James , 32 , has vowed to defy the school 's ban on taking her children to the ` Obby ` Oss celebrations - claiming the rituals are part of her ` religion , culture and heritage .
The school blocked her request under a government crackdown on unauthorised absences in 2013 .
Mrs James said she would be willing to take her children Ethan , 11 , Piran , 5 , and four month old baby Faith to the event .
