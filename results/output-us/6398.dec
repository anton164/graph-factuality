Three reportedly inexperienced abalone divers died after jumping into rough seas off the coast of northern California on Sunday .
The men were part of a group of five divers from the East Coast and San Francisco .
Ten friends had rented a house on Caspar Cove 160 miles north of San Francisco to hunt for abalone , a rare and expensive mollusk .
Abalone is a prized delicacy that sells for up to $ 70 per pound .
