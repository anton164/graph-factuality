 Transport for London has launched a campaign to tackle sexual assault on public transport , with a video in which a female commuter is groped while on the Tube .
The uncomfortable footage sees the woman hounded by an increasingly persistent male , who looks her up and down , gets on to the same train carriage and then gropes her .
According to TLC , one in ten Londoners have experienced unwanted sexual behaviour on public behaviour , but 90 per cent of incidents .
