Field Marshal Erwin Rommel sporting his famous goggles were in fact a five a five from British Major General Michael Gambier-Parry .
He was the one German leader in the Second World War and the stylish goggles he famously wore across his peak cap .
They were given to him by a British prisoner as a gift to thank him for a stolen hat .
The goggles are now housed in a museum dedicated to Rommel in 1941 .
