Michael Carrick 's outstanding second-half performance for England against Italy on Tuesday night has put him on course to become the longest-serving outfield player to represent the Three Lions behind Sir Stanley Matthews .
Carrick made his England debut against Mexico in May 2001 as a teenager with West Ham United and will be the first non-goalkeeper since the Sir Stanley to have an international career spanning more than 15 years .
Matthews won his 54 England caps over a 23-year period between 1934 and 1957 .
