Ben Flower has been urged to be ` a bit more aggressive ' when the prop sensationally sent off in last year 's grand final returns for Wigan in Thursday 's Super League derby with Warrington .
The 28-year-old Welsh international forward on Tuesday completed his six-month ban for twice punching Lance Hohaia in the Grand-Final at Old Trafford .
Wigan coach Shaun Wane says he wants Flower back ` aggressive and stronger and a bit fitter .
