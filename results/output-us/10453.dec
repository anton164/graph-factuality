Everton manager Roberto Martinez was forced to defend another penalty fiasco after Ross Barkley missed from the spot in their 1-0 win against Burnley .
The untried Barkley inexplicably took the 10th minute kick -- awarded for a foul by David Jones -- rather than Leighton Baines , who has scored 15 penalties from 16 attempts in the Premier League .
