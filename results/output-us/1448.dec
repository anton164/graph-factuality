 Just 28 of 700,000 babies born in the UK in 2013 were given the name , data from the Office of National Statistics .
That compares to 235 Garys being born in 1996 , when the name was the 147th most popular in Britain .
In 2013 , it did n't even make the top 1,000 .
Some blame shamed pop star Gary Glitter for the name 's fall from grace .
