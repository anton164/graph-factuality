A museum in Hawaii is preparing to open a treasure-trove of artifacts from the shipwreck of a royal yacht sunk off the coast of Kauai 191 years ago .
Richard Rogers , a Hawaii shipwreck chaser , worked with scientists from the Smithsonian Institution to dredge up the findings from King Kamehameha II , Liholiho , the second king of Hawaii .
Rogers said the king 's belongings were buried in 10 feet of water and sand .
