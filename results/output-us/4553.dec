 Queen Victoria spent her holidays in Osborne House on the Isle of Wight .
It , she would travel to Portsmouth by train and then by ferry to Ryde .
So in 1875 , a station was built at Whippingham , the closest point on the line to Osborne House .
The building is a five-bedroom family home on the market for Â£ 625,000 .
