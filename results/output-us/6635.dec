 Chinese designers have developed an contraption called the Bike Washing Machine that contains a washing machine drum in its front wheel .
When ridden , the pedalling motion causes the drum to rotate , churning your clothes while exercising .
A generator inside the bike also creates electricity which can be stored for future use .
