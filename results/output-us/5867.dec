 Stephen Howells , 39 , and his 25-year-old girlfriend Nicole Vaisey , from Hermon , New York , were charged last summer with sexually exploiting the Amish girls and other children .
They face kidnapping and federal child exploitation charges after police say they abducted the girls , then seven and 12 , from their family 's farm vegetable stand on August 13 .
Guilty pleas would mean the victims would n't have to testify .
