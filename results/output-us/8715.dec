 Francis Bakvis stumbled upon the spectacle on Sunday while searching for his sixteen-year-old pet cat Tiger , who had been missing for three days .
After noticing a foul odour in the yard of his home in Clifton Beach , northern Queensland , Bakvis found a bloated scrub python which contained the remains of the family feline .
Scrub pythons can grow to be up to eight metres long , and are known to eat mammals as large as kangaroos .
