 Christien Sechrist , a 20-year-old from Houston , Texas , had a black and white image of his young son Perseus etched onto the left side of his head in July .
But a snapshot of the tattoo is quickly helping the father to gain national attention after it was shared on Imgur earlier this week .
Christien told he does n't regret his decision to get the ink , claiming he would get it done again .
