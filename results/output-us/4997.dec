 Britons apparently spend Â£ 815million a year to ` social media proof ' their wardrobe , with men for more than women , according to a new study .
The research into the rise of the ` insta-wardrobe ' polled 2,000 adults , revealed nearly one third buy new clothes just to avoid being multi-tagged in the same outfit .
Almost a fifth said they would refuse to wear an outfit again if they knew there was a chance of appearing wearing the same thing online .
