A ` blob ' of water off the West coast of the US could explain why states like California are experiencing their worst ever drought , .
The blob in the ocean was discovered last year with temperatures one to four degrees Celsius -LRB- two to seven degrees Fahrenheit surrounding surrounding ` normal ' water .
And the blob has now extended about 1,000 miles - from Mexico up to Alaska .
And a new University of Washington study says it could be responsible for droughts .
