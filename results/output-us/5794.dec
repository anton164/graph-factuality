Real estate heir and suspected murderer Robert Durst has sent a bizarre letter to a reporter that shares no details about his alleged crime , but observations about life in Los Angeles .
Molly Hennessey-Fiske , a reporter for the Los Angeles Times who has been covering proceedings against Durst , 71 , received a letter purporting to have been written by the suspect in state prison .
Durst was arrested for the 2000 murder of his friend Susan Berman last month .
