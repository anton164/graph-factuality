 Anthony Ray Hinton , 58 , was released from the Jefferson County Jail in Birmingham .
He hugged tearful family members as he walked out and was embraced by his sister : ` Thank you Lord , thank you Jesus .
Hinton says he should not have had to wait 30 years for investigators to test the gun that was seized from his home and determine he could not be linked to the crime .
