The state of Oklahoma has removed protection for gay people who use ride-sharing services Uber and Lyft .
Initially , the Oklahoma Transportation Network Company Services Act included language that prohibited the companies from discriminating against customers based on sexual orientation or gender identity .
However Sen. Jason Smalley has revealed he rewrote the bill to eliminate that language and allow private businesses to establish their own policies regarding discrimination .
