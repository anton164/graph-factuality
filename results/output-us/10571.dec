 inmates of Bergen-Belsen watched as the death camp was burned to the ground .
Shortly after the camp was liberated by British and Canadian troops in 1945 , it was torched , with the Reichskriegs flag and Hitler portrait .
These images were taken by British Reverend Charles Martin King Parsons , who was one of a handful of chaplains who liberate it .
