The federal government is looking to take a line with parents who choose not to vaccinate their children .
Social Services Minister Scott Morrison will reportedly scrap a provision that allows parents who do n't vaccinate children to claim welfare benefits , including $ 726 from Family Tax Benefit and $ 200-a-week from the childcare benefit scheme .
Prime Minister Tony Abbott will announce the changes coming into full effect in January 2016 .
Mr Morrison said the rules around welfare payments need to be ` tightened .
