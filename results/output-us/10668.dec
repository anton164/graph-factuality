 arrows , which can measure up to 70ft in length , are a forgotten remnant of a bygone age .
these arrows were once markers for early airmail flights across the US - forming the first land-based navigation system in the world .
The concrete arrows were placed at the base of lit beacons near airways , showing pilots the monuments .
The arrows in the US Postal service began delivering air mail .
