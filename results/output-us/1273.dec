 20 strangers joined forces to help rescue a dog out of a tar pit .
With no cell phone reception to call for help , owner Tom George had to leave his dog Shelby stuck in a pool by the Great Salt Lake 's Spiral Jetty and drive an hour out to the nearest town .
But a family was willing to stay with Shelby - using grocery bags , car floor mats , tarp , garbage bags and a straw hat .
