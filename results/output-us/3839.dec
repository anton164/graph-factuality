 Jessica Kemp from Eustis says teachers at Seminole County Elementary warned they would remove kindergartner Logan from class because the products , manufactured by Doterra , smell and are a distraction to youngsters around him .
The 32-year-old says she applies the liquid to his head and neck as it helps him keep calm and focused .
She claims her boy has been using them all year , but a teacher 's aide complained .
