 Peter Thurston , 80 , takes his vessel , dubbed the catamavan , , out on the River Swale in Kent regularly and enjoys the views of the countryside .
He says his small yachts were too cramped for leisure cruising and he could n't buy a bigger vessel , so he could buy a caravan boat to take his mind off his divorce .
The boat is fitted with a small engine that reaches four knots .
