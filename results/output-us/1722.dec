A food supplier for supermarket giant Tesco has sacked a farm worker who was caught on camera urinating in a field of vegetables .
A disgusted member of the public snapped the man on his mobile phone after spotting him using the field as a makeshift toilet .
The worker was seen in the middle of the crops urinating on the plants - despite a toilet being only 18 metres away .
Tesco was alerted and sacked the worker with immediate effect .
