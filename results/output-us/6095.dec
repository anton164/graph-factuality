 The little blue and yellow bird made the most of a damaged street light by collecting moss , grass and straw to line her nest .
The blue tit usually takes between one to two weeks to build a nest ready for the female to lay her eggs .
Jeanette Rosenquist , 47 , was on her way to work from her home just outside Copenhagen , Denmark , spotted the bird flying out of the lamp post .
