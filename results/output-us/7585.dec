 Five-year-old Ava Ciach , from Geelong in Victoria , suffered from Sagittal Synostosis - meaning the two plates at the front of her skull had fused together restricting the growth of her brain .
Ava , now six , had to undergo complex surgery in which she had her skull removed , smashed into pieces and put back together like a jigsaw puzzle .
