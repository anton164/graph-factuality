A black flamingo amazed bird watchers when it was spotted feeding among a group of the traditionally pink birds in Cyprus .
The migratory bird was spotted at a salt lake near the British RAF base at Akrotiri on the island 's south coast .
Normally the graceful birds have a pink hue caused by the levels of beto-Carotene in their diet .
