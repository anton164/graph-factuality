A Colorado wastewater facility went up in flames on Friday after a fracking tanker was hit by lightning , setting off a series of explosions and oil fires .
They are working with NGL Energy Partners , the company that owns the site , but had to wait for the explosion risk to subside so they could use fire suppression foam to extinguish the fire .
The tanker was near an injection well where fracking wastewater is pumped into the site .
