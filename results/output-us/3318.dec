 Chip shop worker Jeannie Flynn , 53 , lay stricken in the basement of a Fulham cafe as bricks fell down on top of her - but she was not seriously injured .
Ms Flynn was in a state of sheer panic as she heard passers-by screaming ` get her out because it 's all going to collapse .
She had been walking to her GPs on Thursday morning to walk around a one-foot hole in the pavement .
A worker claims she could have been killed in the accident .
