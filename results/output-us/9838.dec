Britain 's leading art gallery has uncovered new evidence in its attempt to keep a Â£ 1million Constable masterpiece that was looted by the Nazis during the Second World War .
Tate Britain chiefs believe the chance discovery of an export permit will bolster their claim that the 1824 oil painting -- Beaching A Boat , Brighton -- was legitimately brought to Britain .
The permit bears the signature of a dealer called Karola Fabri and seeks permission for artworks from Budapest to Zurich .
