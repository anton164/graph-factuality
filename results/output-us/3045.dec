Outspoken MP Bob Katter accusing the Queensland Government of believing embattled MP Billy Gordon was ` a little black puppet on a string .
In a bizarre statement on his party , Mr Katter said the Government believes Mr Gordon would quit after he was recently accused of domestic violence - and later admitted to his criminal past .
Mr Gordon was forced to quit the Queensland Labor Party last week in the wake of racist violence and withholding his criminal history .
