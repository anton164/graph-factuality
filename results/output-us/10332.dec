 Steven Sloan , joined by friends Michael Niccum and Eugene Dight were on an aluminium rowboat off the west coast of Anderson Island , Washington .
Filming from the boat captured the orcas swimming from afar -- two of them jumping from the water .
The group believe the rope being pulled along the boat is what attracted the whales .
