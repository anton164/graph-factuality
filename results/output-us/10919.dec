The daughter of Second World War Nazi strongman Hermann Goering has failed in her bid to get the state of Bavaria to return family money confiscated after the collapse of the Third Reich .
Goering , who cheated the hangman at Nuremberg by committing suicide shortly before he was due to be executed for war crimes , was deputy to Hitler and the regime 's greatest art thief .
The daughter Edda , 76 , has always refused to criticise him .
