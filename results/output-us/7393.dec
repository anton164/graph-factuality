 Kalimah Dixon said she was awakened by a neighbor yelling there was a fire early on Monday morning , and was lucky to get her children , aged one to 14 , out of the Decatur condo safely .
However all that was left of her rented condo was a pile of rubble , she is asking for assistance .
` My children are homeless .
They have nothing .
They lost everything .
Dixon is to get a lease for a new home while being unemployed .
