 As Orthodox Easter Sunday was held , thousands of homemade rockets were aimed at church towers in the Aegean island of Chios by rival parishioners in their traditional ` mock war .
Dozens of brave souls attend the late-night services inside the churches of Aghios Markos and Panaghia Erithiani .
The custom dates back to the 19th century .
