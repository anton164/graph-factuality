Robert Kennedy Jr has apologized for describing the number of children injured by vaccines as ` holocaust .
The nephew of President John F Kennedy used the term last week during the screening of a film that links autism to a chemical found in several childhood vaccinations - despite evidence to the contrary .
He said he will use other words to describe the autism crisis in the future .
