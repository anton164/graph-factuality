 Ronald Butcher , a ` private and quiet man ' , bequeathed his entire Â£ 500,000 fortune to Daniel Sharp after he died in March 2013 .
But his relatives and family friends insist that the will , made just two months before his death , is invalid .
After the pensioner died at home in Enfield , north London aged 75 , his body was not discovered for almost two months .
