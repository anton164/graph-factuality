If Andrew Strauss becomes England 's new supremo , the comeback hopes of Kevin Pietersen would come to an halt .
Strauss said he can see no way back for the messages Pietersen sent to him as captain three years ago .
Pietersen begins his county comeback with Surrey against Oxford University in Sunday .
