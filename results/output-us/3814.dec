The National Trust has replaced antique furniture with beanbags at one of its historic homes in an ` experiment .
Furniture dating back to 1820 was moved from the library at Ickworth House in Suffolk earlier this year and replaced with four leatherette bean bags .
The move was designed to encourage visitors to ` dwell and take in the room but it .
The National Trust said the beanbag experiment was ` short-term .
