Consumers could soon have to pay goods and services tax on their movie and music downloads .
Treasurer Joe Hockey said the states had agreed to work toward applying the 10 per cent GST to movies and music downloaded from streaming services such as Netflix and Apple .
The changes may also affect consumers buying any products for less than $ 1,000 online from overseas .
But consumer advocacy group says tech-savvy Australian consumers might be able to avoid the tax by concealing their location through virtual private networks .
