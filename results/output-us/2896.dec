Two horses have been rescued after one was found being kept in an alleyway so narrow it could not turn around , while the other was chained to the ground .
RSPCA inspectors were called to the house after they received numerous calls from residents living nearby in Lawrence Weston , Bristol , who were worried about the animals .
The animals are thought to have been kept at the site by the side of a house for around a month .
