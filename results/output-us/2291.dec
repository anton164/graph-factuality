 Japanese women are tying a blue ribbon under the breasts and in a loop over the arms , tying them at the back , so every time they lift their arms , their curves .
The trend was inspired by a ` anime ' cartoon character whose ribbon-bound arms and chest has become her signature .
Hestia 's signature is in the show .
