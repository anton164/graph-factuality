The new chief executive of Rotherham council could be paid up to £ 40,000 more than the outgoing boss , because of ` negative publicity ' from the grooming scandal .
The council will now offer £ 200,000 to candidates , rather than the £ 160,000 enjoyed by former chief boss Martin Kimber .
He left in December after a council report said 1,400 children had suffered horrific sexual abuse .
