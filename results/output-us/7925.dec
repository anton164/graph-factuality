 The Viva Las Vegas Rockabilly Weekend is a flashback to classic cars , vintage pinups , Tiki drinks , tattoos and a fashion aesthetic that balances high heels with just as high hair .
Around 20,000 fans of the era gathered over the weekend for musical performances and car show off the Strip at The Orleans Hotel and Casino .
The organizers have added a second music-only event - the event 's roots .
