Metropolitan police are assessing footage which appears to show Arsenal fans singing a homophobic chant about Ashley Cole .
The video was apparently filmed by a supporter at the Green Man pub in Wembley ahead of Arsenal 's FA Cup semi-final win over Reading .
The footage appears to homophobic chant -- sang along to Lily Allen song Smile -- being aimed at Cole , who left Arsenal to join London rivals Chelsea in 2006 .
