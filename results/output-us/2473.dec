 The man who beat serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer to death inside a Wisconsin prison says he did it because of Dahmer 's creepy sense of humor -- which included turning prison food into fake limbs covered with ketchup to resemble blood .
Christopher Scarver was sentenced to two life terms in prison for killing Dahmer and another man at Columbia Correctional Institution in 1994 .
He says he would leave the fake limbs around the prison .
