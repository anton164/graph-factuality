 Indiana 's religious freedom law has been in hot water .
Gov.
Mike Pence says the state will `` fix '' the Religious Freedom Restoration Act so it will not discriminate against gays and lesbians .
Promoting the false dichotomy between protecting religion versus protecting equality serves no one .
He says it is a good thing for society to shape its laws in ways that allow people to live their lives .
