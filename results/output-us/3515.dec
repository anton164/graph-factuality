Ben Affleck is apologizing after he demanded information be withheld from a PBS show about his family history .
After appearing on Finding Your Roots and learning one of his ancestors was a slave owner , Affleck pushed the network to leave that information out of the program .
This enabled Affleck to hide the identity of his ancestor as James McGuire , who kept eight slaves on his farm in New Jersey in the 1840s .
Today the actor apologized for asking producers to leave out the name in a post on Facebook
