Discount supermarket Aldi is under fire for failing to notify customers of credit card fees six months after it promised the corporate regulator it would .
The Australian Securities and Investments Commission took action against the supermarket company last year after an investigation revealed it did not disclose a 0.5 percent surcharge placed on transactions made using tap and go contactless payment systems in any of its stores .
ASIC also found that ALDI failed to disclose the surcharge it charges consumers paying by credit card in some stores .
