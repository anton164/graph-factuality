Leeds Rhinos have sent full back Zak Hardaker on an anger management course after a student was left with two black eyes and bruising during a violent incident in February .
Hardaker was at the centre of a police assault probe into an attack on a 22-year-old man at student flats in Leeds , but was not charged with any offence .
Leeds said Hardaker 's punishment is far stronger ` given his previous misconduct .
