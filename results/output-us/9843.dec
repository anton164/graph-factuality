 Captured on camera by a visitor to the ABQ BioPark Zoo in Albuquerque , the footage shows the youngster named Jazmine approaching its mother Rozie .
With its front left leg already placed on its mother 's neck , the young elephant clambers onto her with its right leg .
Before steadying itself and lunging forward with both its back legs -- trampling all over Rozie as it tries to balance .
The 22-year-old Asian elephant remains incredibly docile .
