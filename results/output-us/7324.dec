 A mix-up at New Cross Hospital in Wolverhampton meant staff confused the notes of three patients .
As a result , Elizabeth Dawes was wrongly told in July 2013 that she had invasive grade three breast cancer .
Doctors advised she needed immediate surgery , suggesting a double mastectomy .
Ms Dawes refused , but did undergo major surgery to remove a ` cancerous ' tumour from her right breast .
