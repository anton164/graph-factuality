 The Homeless Period project hopes to highlight the misery of women living on the streets and their monthly cycle , and is encouraging people to donate tampons and towels to their local homeless shelter .
A campaign video tells the story of a woman called Patricia , who slept rough on Brixton for six months and was forced to use makeshift sanitary products while menstruating .
The campaign has prompted supporters to start their own collection boxes and sanitary towels in London .
