The largest single high-definition map of mysterious dark matter .
It is the first in a series of maps of the cosmos that will eventually allow a 3D view of dark matter across one eighth of the night sky .
And the map should allow astronomers to study how galaxies formed in the universe .
The goal is to eventually map 12.5 per cent over five years .
Red here shows more dark matter , and blue shows less .
