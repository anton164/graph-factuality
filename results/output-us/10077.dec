 The stunning Ashbrittle Yew , in the churchyard of the parish 's Church of St John the Baptist , has a girth of 38ft and an enormous vast canopy .
Its central trunk is hollow with six smaller ones branching off - possible due to disease .
The 4,000-year-old tree is ` looking extremely sick ' according to a warden .
