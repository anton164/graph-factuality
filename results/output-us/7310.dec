The head of the Drug Enforcement Administration , Michele Leonhart , is expected to resign soon , an Obama administration official says Tuesday .
Leonhart is a career drug agent who has led the agency since 2007 and is the second woman to hold the job .
She has faced mounting pressure from Congress , some questioned her competence in the wake of a government watchdog report detailing allegations that agents attended sex parties with prostitutes .
The Justice Department report she was ` woefully unable to change the agency 's culture .
