Two college campus police officers in Dallas have been placed on administrative leave after shocking video footage surfaced of them harassing a group of four students and arresting one after first hitting him .
The incident occurred at El Centro College and was captured on cell phone by student Charles Adams , who was smoking a cigarette when he witnessed the abuse at first hand last Wednesday .
The school reportedly wo n't say why the teens were stopped and frisked , but Adams believes the officers totally overreacted .
