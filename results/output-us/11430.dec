 Researchers studying chimps in Uganda say the apes are having to adapt to cope with busy roads cutting across their territory .
They found at a busy asphalted road through the Sebitoli area of Kibale National Park in Uganda , the chimps have learned to look both ways before crossing .
It is the first time chimpanzees have been seen to run across roads , while dominant males will wait to cross safely .
