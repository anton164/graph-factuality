Anti-Hillary Clinton street art emerged in Brooklyn just hours before Clinton 's presidential candidacy announcement on Sunday .
The signs feature portraits of Clinton with phrases including ` Dont Say Secretive ' , ` Do n't Say Entitled ' and ` Do Ambitious .
The street art appears to be a group of Clinton supporters who said it would be on the look out for evidence of sexism in reporting about the Democratic politician .
The posters are said to have appeared in Brooklyn on Saturday night near her campaign headquarters
