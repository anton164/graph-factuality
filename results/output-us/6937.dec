 Scientists quizzed more than 5,000 British teenagers about their drinking habits and the films they had watched from a list of 50 , including Bridget Jones ' Diary and Aviator .
Those who had watched the most films featured characters drinking alcohol and 70 per cent more likely to binge drink .
The research also revealed that between 1989 and 2008 almost three quarters of popular UK box office films depicted alcohol use - but only six per cent were classified as adult only .
