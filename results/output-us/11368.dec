A gang of eight dug a 50m underground tunnel in an attempt to steal the ancient treasures inside a 1,400-year-old temple .
The real-life tomb raiders began their daring plan by renting a restaurant across the road from Guanghui Temple in Zhengdin County , North China .
And a team on the inside was digging their way towards the temple 's famous Hua Pagoda .
The tunnel was around 50 metres long when the gang was caught on March 6 .
