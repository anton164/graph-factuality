The son in law of New York politician Sheldon Silver was indicted Monday on two charges unrelated to the investigation into his famous power-broker relative .
Just three months after Silver was arrested on corruption charges , his son-in-law Marcello Trebitsch , 37 , was accused of running a $ 7million Ponzi scheme .
The criminal complaint is filed by him 's daughter Michelle .
