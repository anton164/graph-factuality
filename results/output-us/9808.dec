A young man , who can not be identified for legal reasons , now relies on 24-hour care .
He was born at the Luton and Dunstable Hospital in September 1989 , but was readmitted three months later , suffering a serious brain haemorrhage .
Maternity staff at the hospital failed to administer a vitamin K injection shortly after the man was born .
Vitamin K helps the blood to clot and prevent internal bleeding .
