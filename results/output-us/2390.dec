A Labour government would take action to enforce a Premier League commitment to invest five per cent of the proceeds from lucrative TV rights deals in grassroots sport .
Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said the move could unlock £ 400 million to nurture the talents of the next generation of stars .
And Labour puts £ 168million into grassroots sport , this represents only a fraction of £ 5billion from TV and 2016 .
