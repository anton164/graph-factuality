 David Billing , 48 , had to undergo 14 hours of surgery at Royal Derby Hospital , during which surgeons sawed through his jawbone and removed part of his tongue .
Medics then replaced the lost tissue with muscle from Mr Billing 's arm .
The it still has to return to the hospital every few weeks to have it shaved .
David had to have a new one out of skin from his arm - which still has hairs on it .
