The distinctive patterns on butterfly wings help protect the insects by mimicking the eyes of predators .
While scientists have long suspected the role played by eye-spots found on the wings of many butterflies were an example of mimicry , it has never been tested .
Recently researchers suggested that the eye spots may simply scare away predators by confusing them or overloading their senses .
Now scientists have found that a moth has an unusual evolutionary adaptation that allows it to confuse the predators like birds .
