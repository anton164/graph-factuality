 Colby Ramos-Francis , who is 17 months old , was born with a small , heart-shaped growth over his eyelid .
But it quickly developed into a large benign tumour that continued to expand .
His parents claim NHS doctors were unable to treat the growth or offer surgery , leaving them no option but to beg for help abroad .
Colby had now had the tumour removed free-of-charge thanks to the US-based Little Baby Face Foundation .
