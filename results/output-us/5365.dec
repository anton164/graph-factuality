 Facebook has launched a new app called Hello designed to give you more control over who can call you and how their details appear - even if their number is n't stored in your contacts book .
It pulls in any publicly-shared data from a user 's Facebook profile and lets you block unwanted callers .
The free app is currently in testing and is only available on Android devices in the US .
