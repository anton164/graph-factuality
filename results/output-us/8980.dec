Photographs taken with the very first ` secret ' handheld camera will go on display on Saturday at the State Library giving Sydneysiders a rare chance to take a glimpse of what life in Sydney looked like .
The Crowd Source collection holds around 150 photographs taken by Arthur Syer , a 27-year-old man living in Sydney who took advantage of the first hand held camera , the Detective Camera .
The detective camera emerged from this style of photography and the photographers were called snap shooters .
