 Vietnamese labourer Pham Quang Lanh , 28 , had a metal plate inserted over his skull after being struck by an iron bar on a building site .
But the botched operation caused his head to become swollen with a potentially deadly infection .
Doctors said the infestation had saved Mr Lanh 's life by eating the infected tissue .
