The U.S. Senate voted on Thursday to approve Loretta Lynch as President Barack Obama 's next attorney general , ending a five-month deadlock that made Lynch , 55 , was approved by a 56-43 vote .
Curiously absent from the final vote was Texas Senator Ted Cruz - a key opponent of Lynch 's nomination .
She is expected to take over as head of the Justice Department on Monday , replacing Eric Holder .
