 Town halls do not accept five or 10 pence coins brought in three years ago .
Town halls have failed to recalibrate some of the 100,000 ticket machines in the UK - making it impossible for drivers to pay the cost of parking .
In Manchester , motorists without old-style coins must use £ 1 and two 20p pieces for a £ 1.25 hour 's parking - handing the council a 15p profit .
