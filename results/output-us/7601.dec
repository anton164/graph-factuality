 Dale Cregan is on hunger strike for the second time in a bid to be moved from prison to a secure psychiatric hospital .
The 31-year-old was reportedly transferred to solitary confinement in HMP Manchester , formerly Strangeways , a month ago after being caught smuggling a mobile phone and cannabis into his prison cell .
He is hoping to be transferred to Ashworth Hospital , a high-security psychiatric unit .
