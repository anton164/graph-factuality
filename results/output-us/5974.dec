 Dug and his owner Lindsay Castro were hiking on the Jurupa Hills trail in Fontana , Canada , on Thursday when they heard a rattling sound .
Lindsay backed away , but Dug ran up to the reptile - and suffered the consequences .
The snake bit Dug in the face , and his face instantly ballooned to twice its size .
