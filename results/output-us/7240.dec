Hundreds of morning commuters in Boston were delayed today after a truck crashed on an elevated highway and rail tracks .
The box truck collided with a car on Interstate 93 southbound in the city 's Dorchester neighborhood at about 6 am , and both drivers were taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries .
As officials did n't want to risk running trains under the over-hanging truck , replacement shuttle buses were run for southbound passengers with long queues forming .
