A experiment to help dementia patients by waking them up with video recordings is taking place in New York .
The hope is that the videos shown to residents of a care home in the city will ease their confusion , forgetfulness and agitation .
The idea is borrowed from the 2004 Adam Sandler film 50 First Dates , in Drew Barrymore 's character suffers a brain injury and memory loss .
People suffering Alzheimer 's disease and other forms of dementia inspired a new dementia experiment .
