Eating fast food after a workout , it did n't matter what food was eaten .
Performance remained the same after resting for several hours , while levels of glycogen - used by muscles as ` fuel ' - were slightly higher after fast food was a recovery food .
In the study , 11 male athletes were asked to fast for 12 hours , before a 90-minute endurance workout .
