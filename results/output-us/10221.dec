Neanderthals may have eaten recently deceased friends and family either for food or in bizarre funeral rituals .
This is according to marks found on the fossils of two adults and a child unearthed in the French region of Poitou-Charentes .
Similar marks have been seen at other Neanderthal sites showing how our ancestors cut and fractured the bones of their dead relatives .
