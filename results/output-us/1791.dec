 Linda and George Hunter , who raised their four children in their home in Garrick Street , Wavertree , Liverpool , became mortgage free around 15 years ago .
But eight years ago , the street became part of a regeneration scheme and the council bought properties and boarded them up ready for demolition .
Estate agents say the couple would now struggle to sell their home for much more than Â£ 1 as other houses in the street are being sold at that price by the council .
