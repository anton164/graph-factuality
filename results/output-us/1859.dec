 Simba was rescued by firefighters in Meckenheim , near Bonn , Germany , after a neighbour heard scratching in her newly refitted bathroom .
Owners Helga and Eberhard Henkel had lost their pet in early March and had looked everywhere .
It is thought the animal had crawled under the floor as the bathroom was being renovated .
