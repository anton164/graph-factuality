 Mum Gitte Denteneer asked staff at the Rubens eaterie in Leuven , Belgium , to warm up some milk for her two-month old son Lucca .
But when she came to pay , she was stunned to find that 50 cents had been added onto the bill .
Her total bill came to around Â£ 20 , including an omlette , two cappuccinos and two caramel desserts .
