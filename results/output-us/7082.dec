 Major General Allen Batschelet says that 10 percent of young men and women who sign up to join the Army are currently refused because they are too heavy .
Batsletlet warns that as many as half of young Americans will be so grossly overweight by the end of the decade that the military will be unable to recruit enough qualified soldiers .
The maximum body fat percentage that the army is 20-20 is 20 percent for men and 30 percent for recruits .
