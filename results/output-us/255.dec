 Maria Malone-Guerbaa , 41 , from London , used nothing but paints to turn herself into an uncanny painting of a grey rabbit with blue eyes , wearing a red bow tie .
The mother-of-two said she did n't use any prosthetics or special effects to achieve the result .
She used her own brushes and kryolan paint to create the bunny 's head .
