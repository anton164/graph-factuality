Scientists from the University of Wollongong are designing ultra-durable condoms they could feel even better than nothing at all .
The contraceptive is made with hydrogel , a strong and flexible solid can be made to feel and act like human tissue .
The design will eventually offer functions like self-lubrication , topical drug delivery , and electric conductivity .
The team won a grant for a next generation condom in 2013 , giving them $ 100,000 to use research .
