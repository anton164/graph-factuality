 US Department of the Treasury officials insist the $ 20 Double Eagles were stolen from the US Mint in Philadelphia before the 1933 series was melted down when the country went off the gold standard .
They argued that Joan Langbord and her sons can not lawfully own the coins , she found in a family bank deposit box in 2003 .
A appeals court returned the coins to the Langbords family after a legal dispute with the government .
