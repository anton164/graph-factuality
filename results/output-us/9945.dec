 Vet Nick Fisher , 31 , from Leintwardine , Shropshire said Twiglet was left behaving strangely after swallowing the unidentified substance while on a walk near their home last Monday .
The four-year-old hound seemed to think he was being chased and had dilated pupils and bloodshot eyes after eating the drugs near the village bus stop .
But after 45 minutes of drooling at the mouth uncontrollably , shaking and walking into walls he seemed back to normal .
