Hillary Clinton imposed a blanket of secrecy on her movements at the height of the Monica Lewinsky scandal and told aides they would be fired if she was seen , it is claimed .
Mrs Clinton said she wanted nobody to know when she was going to the pool .
There she would spend three and a half hours sitting on her own reading , a new book .
The book is written by Kate Andersen Brower , a former White House correspondent for Bloomberg News .
