 Wellington Silva has finally received clearance to make his Gunners bow after being granted a Spanish passport .
He signed for Arsenal in January 2011 from Fluminese for a fee of Â£ 3.5 million but has been able to play for the club without a work permit .
His passport means he can now play for any team in the European Union .
