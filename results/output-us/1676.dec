 Felix the cat has been missing for almost a week after he escaped from his crate at John F Kennedy International Airport .
The two-year-old grey tabby belongs to Jennifer Stewart , 31 , and her husband , Joseph Naaman , said the airline-approved pet carrier was damaged so badly -- apparently while being transferred from the plane -- that Felix was able to get out and run away .
Felix 's crate was tied down to a metal pallet and cracked open .
