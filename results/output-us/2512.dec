 The High Court threw out rules introduced to stop violent prisoners being transferred out of high-security jails .
The policy was brought in after fugitive armed robber Michael Wheatley walked out of an open jail in May while on day release and went on to commit an armed robbery which was caught on CCTV .
But two senior judges at London 's High Court have ruled excluding transfers for a history of absconding was unlawful .
