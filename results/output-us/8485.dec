 Lucy Gransbury , wrote a two-page rant claiming her neighbours were keeping her awake at night .
Grans thought thought the note worked wonders after an entire week of uninterrupted sleep .
So she followed up by dropping a thank-you card and gifts over the fence to the seven or eight men who was ` too scared ' to knock on their door .
But Jershon Witehira posted an reply to his Facebook page .
