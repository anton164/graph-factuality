SpaceX has released footage of its third attempt to land a rocket booster on a barge in the Atlantic .
The video , taken from a plane yesterday shows the Falcon 9 booster lowering itself onto the platform , before a gust of wind sways it to one side .
The 14-storey booster manages to hit the barge , but its high speed and tilt causes it to explode on impact .
United Launch Alliance has unveiled plans to launch a reusable rocket named ` Vulcan ' in 2019 .
