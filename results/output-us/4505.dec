 EE shops are planning to give away free portable chargers .
Once the EE ` power bar ' runs down , customers will be able to swap it for a new one at any EE shop , or spend four hours charging it up themselves at home .
The chargers will be free to EE customers , and other smartphone owners can also sign up to the service if they pay a Â£ 20 fee .
