 An account purporting to be Sydney radio station 2UE sent out a tweet on Thursday morning which appears to have come from a disgruntled former employee .
The hashtag was in reference to the station 's former newsreader Steve Blanda , who had read the news at 2UE for over a decade .
While the tweet has since been removed from the @ 2UEN Twitter account .
