Former AFL star Ben Cousins left court with a morning spent in handcuffs and in police custody before he finally fronted court .
Cousins smiled as he left Fremantle Magistrates Court despite the magistrate labelling him ` a risk to the public ' and warning him that he now faces a jail term for the ` serious ' offences he has committed .
Cousins was supposed to appear in court to face reckless driving charges on Wednesday morning .
Cousins surrendered himself at Fremantle Police Station .
