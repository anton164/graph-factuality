 Researchers from London and Edinburgh have developed a computer that can collate meterological information and then produce forecasts as if they were written by a human .
It uses a process known as ` natural language generation ' -LRB- NLG .
These computer-generated weather updates are being tested by scientists at Heriot-Watt University and University College London .
NLG is the process of producing readable texts in English , or other languages , automatically on a computer .
