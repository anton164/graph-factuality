 Jan Hansen 's egg is so big that it took him three days to put together and is made from layers of Belgian chocolate which covers an iron frame .
The creation had to be completed using a step ladder and is the equivalent of 1,600 chocolate bars .
Mr Hansen hopes to raise Â£ 1,000 from the egg for St Barnabas Hospice .
