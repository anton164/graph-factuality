Tommy Connolly had n't seen his teenage cousin in 10 years when she added him on Facebook in December .
He messaged his 17-year-old cousin Angela to see how she was doing and soon found out she was homeless , illiterate and 32 weeks pregnant .
Mr Connolly picked her up from where she was sleeping rough on the Gold Coast and is helping to raise her four-week-old baby boy .
