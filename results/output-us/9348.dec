Online blogging sensation Zoella has come under fire from Jamie Oliver 's company over adverts for unhealthy foods on YouTube .
Internet star Zoella , 25 , and fellow vlogger and boyfriend Alfie Deyes , 21 , should be more aware of adverts .
It comes after an investigation found that video blogs - known as vlogs -- popular with children aged 11 to 17 are being hijacked by 30-second adverts to junk food and online gambling sites .
