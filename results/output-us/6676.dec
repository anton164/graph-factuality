Pope Francis has angered the Turkish government by describing the mass-murders of up to 1.5 million Armenians in 1915 as ` first genocide of the 20th century .
The pontiff made the comments at a 100th anniversary Mass on Sunday , prompting Turkey to summon the Holy See 's ambassador in Ankara in protest .
Today was the first time a pope has publicly used ` genocide ' to describe the massacre .
