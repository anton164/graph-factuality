Dylan Miller , a senior at Juniata College , in Huntingdon , Pennsylvania , decided for his senior project that he would live in a hut deep in the woods about a half-hour 's walk from campus to learn about living with only the necessities .
He hopes living in his nine-foot-tall , 17-by-17ft hut will teach him about living simply .
There is no plumbing or electricity in the structure .
