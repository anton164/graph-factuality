An investigation spanning almost three years into the yearly cost of gun violence covered by U.S. taxpayers has determined the figure to be over $ 229 billion .
The new study , by independent political magazine Mother Jones , was spawned by the mass shooting in Aurora , Colorado , in July 2012 during a midnight screening of The Dark Knight rises , in which 12 people were killed and 70 injured .
At least 750,000 people were injured by guns in 2012 .
