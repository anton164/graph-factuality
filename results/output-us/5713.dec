 People who have never been divorced can expect a retirement income 13 per cent higher than a colleague who has been through a divorce .
It means an extra £ 2,100 a year -- £ 17,800 rather than £ 15,700 -- to anyone who has kept their marriage intact , or who has never married .
one in five divorcees who stop work this year will retire with debts to drag down their disposable income and lifestyles .
