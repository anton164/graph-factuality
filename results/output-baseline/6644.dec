Rodrigo Gularte, 42, asked 'Am I being executed?' as he was being chained up to be transported to the jungle clearing on Nusakambangan island .
He and seven other death row inmates were killed by firing squad in the early hours of Wednesday morning .
Irish priest appointed to be Gularte's spiritual advisor said he talked to Gularte for an hour and a half late on Tuesday night to prepare him for the executions .
Gularte was arrested in 2004 for attempting to smuggle six kilograms of cocaine into Indonesia .
