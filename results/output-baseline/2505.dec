Navinder Singh Sarao, 36, is accused of making £26m by 'spoofing' the stock market .
He lived in his parents' modest modest home in west London because it gave him a nanosecond advantage over rivals in the City .
Sarao allegedly made £550,000 in five minutes on the day of the 'Flash Crash' of 2010, the biggest one-day collapse in Wall Street history .
His thousands of high-frequency trades could be processed faster than those from Central London .
