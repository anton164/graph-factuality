Sonnenspeicher uses a lithium iron phosphate battery to store energy harvested during the day by solar panels fitted to a roof .
This energy is used throughout the day, and any excess is stored for when the sun goes down .
Instead of selling this energy back to the grid, homeowners can use it to power their home until the sun rises again .
