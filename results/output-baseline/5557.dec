Jason McDonald, 34, from Aurora, Colorado, walked the slackline over a pool containing more than 50 of the alligators .
He had never been bitten before last month when an 8ft alligator clamped down on his hand for more than 10 minutes .
Mr McDonald said he thought this would be an interesting new way of interacting with the creatures .
