Charity runners taking part in Bournemouth Bay Run were sent on an unscheduled two-mile detour .
They continued past the unmanned marshall point and had to run for an extra three kilometres while the other 900 competitors followed the correct route .
The blunder was believed to have been caused by a race marshal taking a toilet break during the race .
Organisers have appealed for those affected by the blunder to contact them for a 'gesture of goodwill'
