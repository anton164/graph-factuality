Sofia Vergara's ex-fianc√© Nick Loeb says he's always 'dreamed' of being a father .
The 39-year-old filed a lawsuit last August over the two fertilized embryos that the couple created together .
Loeb said he wants to use the embryos to have children of his own - either with the involvement of his wife or without her .
'I have always believed that life begins at conception and that every embryo is life on the journey towards birth,' he said .
