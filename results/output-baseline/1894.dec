Rajpal Singh, 34, had hundreds of coins and other objects removed from his stomach after complaining of a stomach ache .
Over a three year period, he had swallowed 140 coins, 150 nails and nuts .
Doctors were amazed when an endoscopy revealed hundreds of foreign objects in his stomach .
Mr Singh said he didn't realise his stomach pain was due to his habit of eating metal objects .
He said: 'Doctors told me that sharp objects would have punctured my intestine and I would have eventually died'
