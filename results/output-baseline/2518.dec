Dr. Nikita Levy, 54, was fired from Johns Hopkins Health System in February 2013 after it was discovered he had secretly filmed and photographed thousands of women during gynecological exams .
Lawyers had originally asked for a 35 percent settlement fee, but the ruling by a Baltimore judge means they will only receive 17.25 per cent .
Levy committed suicide ten days later, days after a co-worker alerted hospital authorities about her suspicions and he was forced to turn over the camera .
