Kate Roberts, 24, noticed her son Miles had a slightly different shaped head .
At three months, he was diagnosed with brachycephaly, also known as 'flat-head syndrome'
This means the back of the head becomes flattened and the front of the skull bulge out .
She raised Â£2,000 in just 24 hours to pay for a special helmet for Miles .
As it is not medically dangerous, the NHS does not pay for treatment .
Parents are advised to move their children on to tummies during the day .
