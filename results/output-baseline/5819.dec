Singer-songwriter Don McLean offered the wistful anthem that asks 'Do you recall what was revealed the day the music died?' at Christie's on Tuesday .
The 16-page notes include the words 'I dropped to my knees and there I prayed and I promised him everything I could give him'
The eight-minute-long song was released in 1971 and was a No. 1 U.S. hit for four weeks in 1972 .
