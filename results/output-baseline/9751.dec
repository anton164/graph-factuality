Scientists believe the first complex conversation between humans and humans gradually took place around 50,000 to 100,000 years ago .
They say single words bear traces of syntax showing that these layers of language blended rapidly with a 'lexical' layer, as seen in birdsong .
The 'integration hypothesis' suggests that humans combined an 'expressive' layer of language with alexical layer, rather than from primitive utterances .
One word today can be 'internally complex, often as complex as an entire phrase'
