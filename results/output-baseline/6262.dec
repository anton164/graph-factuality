The cubs, born March 11, were captured on video sitting before press and public at Leningrad Zoo in Saint Petersburg .
They are the fifth brood of mother and father Agnes and Rock .
Jaguars are solitary animals and only see each other while mating, so zoo keepers intend on keeping Rock in a separate enclosure .
