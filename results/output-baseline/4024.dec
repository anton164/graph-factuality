Hackers completely cut transmission of 11 channels belonging to Paris-based TV5 Monde and took over its websites and social media accounts for three hours early this morning .
They posted documents purporting to be the identity cards of relatives of French soldiers involved in anti-ISIS operation in Iraq and Syria .
Channel's director Yves Bigot said the network has restored its signal but can only broadcast pre-recorded programmes, not live content .
