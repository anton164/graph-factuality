Navy's X-47B drone is one of two Unmanned Carrier Air Vehicle demonstrators .
It plugged its in-flight refuelling probe into the hose of an Omega Air KC-7C tanker off the coast of Maryland .
During the test, it trailed the Omega Air Refuelling 707 tanker from a mile off before using optical sensors and a video camera to monitor its approach to within 20 feet .
This is the final test of the MQ-4C Triton, which will be donated to museums despite only having 20 per cent of its flight hours .
