The tiny home is sandwiched between two double fronted properties on a leafy street in Islington, north London .
It was put on the market with Foxtons for Â£750,000 - almost double the price it sold for in 2001 .
At its widest, it stretches across 8ft 8in in some areas, a little over the size of a rugby net .
