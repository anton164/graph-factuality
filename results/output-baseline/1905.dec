Lance Futch, 26, wore a white wrinkled polo shirt and drove to Hill Air Force Base in Utah thinking he was going to be led into an auditorium .
Instead, he was sat at a table with Obama, Utah Senator Orrin Hatch, and Salt Lake City Mayor Ralph Becker - all wearing suits and ties .
'If I had known it was my Commander-in-Chief, I definitely would have been wearing my blues,' said Futch .
