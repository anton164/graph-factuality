King Charles Spaniel suffered three degree burns after a scan last month .
Owner Lynne Edwards, 64, said she only realised something was wrong when he started refusing food and found puss oozing from his back .
She then took him to a local vet, where staff clipped his fur and exposed the severe burns in a microwave .
The animal is now on medication while his wounds heal, but could face surgery .
