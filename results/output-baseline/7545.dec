Valerie Rutty, of Warrington, Cheshire, altered invoices by increasing prices of work she had commissioned - then paid the difference between the actual sums into her own bank account by cheque from the school fund .
The 60-year-old stole almost Â£3,500 from the fund raised by parents, teachers and pupils through non-uniform days and other fundraisers .
She was handed a four-month suspended sentence and ordered to carry out 70 hours of unpaid work in the community .
