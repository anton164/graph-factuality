Hilary Border, 54, from Nottinghamshire, had power of attorney over 83-year-old's affairs when her dementia-stricken mother Dorothy's health deteriorated .
Care home staff tried to contact Border over £16,000 debt over two years .
But when it doubled to £600 the money was either late or stopped being paid at all .
Border was sentenced to 16 months in prison, suspended for two years, at Nottingham Crown Court yesterday .
