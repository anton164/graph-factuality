The state's largest teacher's union is calling Christie out for his 'bullying' behavior .
'He's always taken a very nasty and disrespectful tone with teachers and other individuals who dare to question him at these events,' Steve Wollmer of the NJ Education Association said .
Christie settled a $225million legal settlement with ExxonMobil which could have contributed to the state's pension plans for teachers .
