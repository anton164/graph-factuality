Researchers at the University of Huddersfield have created a technique to distinguish between the genetic fingerprints of identical twins .
Identical twins start life with the same genes because they come from same fertilised egg which divides into two embryos .
But as they age different life experiences create variations in the number of hydrogen bonds in the DNA, the higher the temperature required to melt them .
