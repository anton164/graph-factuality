Gareth Bale broke down after less than five minutes of Real Madrid's league game against Malaga on Saturday evening .
The Welsh forward will almost certainly miss the Champions League semi-final .
Bale has not been injured since October of last year when he ran half the length of the pitch to score the winner in the Copa del Rey final .
Cristiano Ronaldo was the first player to go over to Bale as he sat waiting for treatment .
