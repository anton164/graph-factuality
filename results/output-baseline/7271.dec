President Barack Obama said Tuesday that likely Republican presidential candidate Scott Walker would 'absolutely' cancel or 'disown' a deal with Iran on 'day one'
Walker fired back at Obama on Twitter, saying, 'Americans would be better served by a President who spent more time working with governors & Congress rather than attacking them'
'If that starts being questioned, that's going to embolden our enemies,' the president added .
