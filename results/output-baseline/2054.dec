Austin Bird, one of the three young Iowans pictured at a coffee shop in LeClaire, Iowa, on Tuesday morning, was asked to meet him and two other young men .
The three got the lion's share of Mrs. Clinton's time and participated in a 'roundtable' - the first of many in her brief campaign swing .
Bird is a Democratic Party insider who was tapped to chauffeur Vice President Joe Biden in October 2014 when he visited Davenport, Iowa .
