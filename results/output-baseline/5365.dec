Facebook has launched a new app called Hello to give you more control over who can call you and how their details appear .
It pulls in any publicly-shared data from a user's Facebook profile and lets you easily block unwanted callers .
When a user receives a call, Hello shows them info about who’s calling, even if they don’t have that number .
The free app is currently only available on Android devices in the US .
