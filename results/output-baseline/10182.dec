Campaign group GetUp launched The Gender Price Gap website last week .
Members and everyday consumers have identified nine products that have identical female versions which cost more for women .
The exact same shirt advertised under the men's clothing section is advertised for only $49.95 .
Other examples highlight the absurd and unexplained price differences even though the products are identical in every way except whether they are targeted towards women .
