A row between neighbours over a 40ft leylandii hedge started 35 years ago .
The hedge stood 40ft tall and died in the shade of a neighbour's garden shed .
Stirling Council has finally ruled that the hedge can stay, despite claims it has knocked Â£20,000 off the value of neighbour's house .
Mrs Alexander, 54, said: 'I would rather move than touch these trees'
