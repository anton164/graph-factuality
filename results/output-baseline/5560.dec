The House Judiciary Committee passed the latest version of a bill known as the USA Freedom Act by a bipartisan vote of 25 to 2 .
It would allow phone companies, not the NSA, to request certain records held by the telephone companies under a court order in terrorism investigations .
A similar bill was introduced in the U.S. Senate last year, but narrowly failed a procedural vote in the Senate .
