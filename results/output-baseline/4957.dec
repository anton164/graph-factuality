Peter Reece, his fiancee, mother and six-month-old daughter were parked on an Ocean Shores beach on Thursday when their tires got stuck in the sand .
The wheels of the car sunk into the wet sand so they were unable to drive away .
Reece and his family were able to get out and led them up the beach .
A bulldozer was used to flip the car on its right side before it was towed to the road .
