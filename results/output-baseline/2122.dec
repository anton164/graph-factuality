The Automated Planet Finder (APF) consists of a 2.4-metre automated telescope and enclosure, and a high-resolution spectrograph .
All three planets orbit the star, HD 7924, at a distance closer than Mercury orbits the sun, completing their orbits in just 5, 15 and 24 days .
The Astrophraph takes starlight from the telescope and spreads it into a rainbow of colours, splitting the light into a spectrum of thousands of different wavelengths that can be measured with great precision .
