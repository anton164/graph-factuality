Heidi Bretscher, 28, was running the Rock N' Roll Raleigh Marathon in Raleigh, North Carolina .
She was so far ahead of her closest competitor that she ran entirely off the planned route and around a lake that wasn't even on the course .
The route changed from the 2014 race to help ease the traffic and impact on local residents .
