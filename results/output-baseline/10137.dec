Neighbours claim housing bosses are trying to perpetuate a false image of the area by giving it a makeover ahead of the show's release .
The show follows the lives of a handful of benefits claimants last year .
Residents say the street is normally 'quite a grotty street' and the front gardens were filled with rubbish .
But the housing association said the work was planned well in advance and were nothing to do with the programme .
