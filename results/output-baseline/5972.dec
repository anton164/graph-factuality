Pitt, 51, personally backed the building of 104 homes in the Lower Ninth quarter of New Orleans, decimated by the 2005 storm .
Pitt's charity is suing Timber Treatment Technologies for $500,000 - claiming the wood was defective .
The charity says it was forced to replace decking and other wood on the new homes after using Timber Treatment's TimberSIL product .
In a lawsuit filed in New Orleans’ District Court last week, Pitt’s charity said the timber had undergone a special ‘environmentally friendly glass-wood fusion process’ to prevent rot and decay .
