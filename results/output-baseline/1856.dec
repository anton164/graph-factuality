UK researchers studied the asteroid impact 66 million years ago .
They found the heat near the impact site in Mexico was not intense enough to ignite plant material .
A heat pulse lasted less than a minute, too short to set plants alight .
The impact site is believed to be the 125 mile (200km) Chicxulub crater buried underneath the Yucat√°n Peninsula in Mexico .
