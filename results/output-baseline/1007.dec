Sabrina Broadbent Tetzner, 32, fled the FLDS sect eight years ago and finally gained full custody of her four children last week .
She was physically stopped by hundreds of polygamists who surrounded her vehicle and threatened her with a cow and chickens .
Tetzner spent the night in her van, fearing the children would not be able to see her .
A Mohave County judge ordered the sect to turn over the children at 5pm Thursday .
