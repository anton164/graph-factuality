John Lewis has slashed prices on almost 200 products in an attempt to flog Christmas trees, festive ornaments and decorations .
The department store has halved the price of many of its decorations and trees - knocking as much as £250 off the 9ft John Lewis Pre-Lit Peardrop with 500 lights, formerly £500 .
A 64cm high 'Cambric and Cream Father Christmas Sack' is now available to buy half price at £17.50 on the store's website .
