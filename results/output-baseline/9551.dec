Volvo teamed up with a Swedish start-up to make a temporary light reflective spray for cyclists, called Life Paint .
It contains powder-fine reflective particles designed to react to a car’s headlights, alerting drivers to the presence of cyclists in the dark .
The spray washes off but can last for days on bike frames and even pets’ collars .
