Amber Phillips of Los Angeles expressed her support for the right to die for terminally ill patients when her mother died in 2012 .
She said that at the time it was not a legal option for her to end her life via physician assisted suicide .
'The pain and suffering took some of her dignity away when she became so ill that she was not able to enjoy her life,' said Debbie Zieglaer, the mother of terminal brain cancer sufferer Brittany Maynard .
