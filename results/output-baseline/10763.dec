Ba Van Nguyen piloted a CH-47 Chinook, the largest helicopter in the South Vietnamese army, to safety on April 30, 1975 .
He managed to get out of his flight suit and jump into the sea just seconds before it crashed - all on his own .
Nguyen then flew back out to sea and jumped into the South China Sea .
The USS Kirk was too small to withstand the force of such a large helicopter .
In an interview with CNN, he said: 'If you hear a Chinook coming, get ready'
