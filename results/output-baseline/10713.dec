Tour operators Natural World Safaris are offering the rare trip to Durminskoye Reserve in Khabarovsk, Russia .
They will sleep in the natural habitat of the Siberian tiger, one of the world's most endangered animals .
Visitors will spend time in the wild environs inhabited by the last remaining Siberian tigers .
The safari does not actively track them as this risks guests coming face-to-face with the animals themselves .
