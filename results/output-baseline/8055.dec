Domenico Rancadore was given a seven-year sentence in 1999 for being a member of the Cosa Nostra gang .
He fled to Britain in 1995 and was told he must return to Italy to serve his sentence .
But in February he lost his year-and-a-half battle against extradition .
His case expired last October and his European Arrest Warrant is to be withdrawn .
The case will still have to be heard by the Italian Supreme Court .
