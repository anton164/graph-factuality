Liberal Democrats will pledge to protect the entire education budget in next parliament ‘from cradle to college’
It is understood that spending would rise per pupil – with an extra 460,000 schoolchildren expected in the next five years – and also in line with inflation from 2018-19 .
The Lib Dem leader will say this is a deal-breaker in any future coalition talks after May 7 .
Education is a sore point for many who backed the Lib Dems in 2010 on promise that the party would scrap tuition fees and then see them trebled to £9,000 a year .
