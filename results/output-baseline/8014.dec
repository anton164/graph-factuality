Huw Thomas suggested on an online forum in 2006 that flags were for a 'simpleton' or a 'casual racist'
He posted his views on a Welsh language website called Mais E .
He said: 'I agree it is totally sickening the number of English flags to be seen around Wales'
Mr Thomas said people in Ceredigion 'deserve an MP that will admit when they are wrong'
