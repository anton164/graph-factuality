Mike Hand, 39, was diagnosed with a tumour on his spinal cord on his spine .
He was told he could only have a disability grant to adapt his home .
But he and his wife Kate, who have an eight-year-old daughter, were told they were not eligible .
They were told that because they don't claim any income support, they would have to earn 'virtually nothing' to receive the grant .
Mr Hand is almost ready to leave St Helen's Hospital after undergoing surgery .
