Randy Pierce, from Nashua, New Hampshire, lost his sight when he was just 22 years old, from a neurological disease that left him in a wheelchair .
He was one of 10 percent of competitors to successfully successfully ring a bell while swinging a rope 25 feet above the air .
The challenge required Pierce to jump off a ledge and grab a piece of rope that he needed to swing to a bell .
Pierce decided to run the 'King of the Swingers' obstacle course in honor of Quinn after the dog passed away from bone cancer last year .
