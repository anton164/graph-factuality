Researchers at the CNR Institute of Clinical Physiology in Pisa, Italy, used CT scans of a pair of ancient baby teeth found in Riparo Bombrini in western Italy .
They found the teeth belonged to the Protoaurignacian culture - an early group of humans from this culture .
The discovery has settled a debate over whether the teeth and other artefacts were Neanderthals or Homo sapiens in origin .
