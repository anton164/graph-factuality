Gavin Munro, 39, grew trees directly into plastic moulds, pruning and guiding the branches into shape before grafting them together to form ultra-tough joints .
Using this method he has a crop of 400 tables, chairs and lampshades which he hopes will be ready by 2017 .
Mr Munro is also experimenting with ash, sycamore, hazel, crab apple and red oak .
