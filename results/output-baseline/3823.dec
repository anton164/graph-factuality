James Holmes is charged with multiple counts of murder and attempted murder in the July 2012 shooting of a packed theater in Aurora, Colorado .
Prosecutors say Holmes knew what he was doing, but schizophrenia had taken control of his mind and compelled him to kill .
'It smelled very, very bad, the movie was still playing, the alarm was going off,' said one witness .
Holmes' lawyers are asking the jury to find him not guilty by reason of insanity, which would send him to state mental hospital indefinitely .
