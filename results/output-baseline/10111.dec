Victorino Chua, 49, is accused of poisoning three patients at Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport between 2011 and 2012 .
The Filipino nurse wrote a 'bitter nurse confession' in which he spelled out 'how an angel can turn to an evil person'
He also wrote that he might 'explode' at any time, adding: 'If I will be pushed, they gonna be sorry'
His lawyers say the document is not a criminal confession but an 'outlet for his anger and frustration'
