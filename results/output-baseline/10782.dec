As waters around the UK get warmer, species of fish, including haddock, plaice and lemon sole could become less common as they migrate to more preferable water temperatures .
As the North Sea warms, species won't be able to migrate north to avoid warming temperatures because habitat of a suitable depth is rare .
This could lead to shrimps and prawns struggling to build shells and skeletons .
