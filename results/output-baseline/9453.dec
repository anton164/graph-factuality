Tony Morris QC is mounting a landmark legal challenge against Queensland's speed-camera laws .
He says it's unconstitutional for a Queensland court to fine him when there's evidence he was not the driver .
Mr Morris argues the spousal privilege principle, established in England 200 years ago, means a husband can't be compelled to provide information that incriminates his wife .
