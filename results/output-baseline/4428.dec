Bill Parker, 34, of Gulfport, Mississippi was mowing his lawn on April 19 when he thought a rock hit him in the face not realizing it was a metal fence wire .
After going to Memorial Hospital a scan revealed the metal wire had been shot up his left nostril and was lodged in Parker's sinus cavity beneath his eye socket and next to his jaw hinge .
Dr Timothy Haffey removed the wire with a simple sinus surgery which took 20 minutes and entailed making an incision on Parker's upper lip .
