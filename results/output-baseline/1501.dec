Seven female students, some of whom attend Brigham Young University in Utah, were catfished by the same 24-year-old woman named Kayla in Texas .
Kayla apologized to the women and said she was trying to figure out who she was because it's 'difficult' to be both gay and Mormon .
The women had a chance to confront Kayla on an episode of Dr Phil on Friday .
