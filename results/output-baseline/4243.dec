Nick Scholfield has been lined up to ride Jim Culloty's Spring Heeled in the Crabbie’s Grand National at Aintree on April 11 .
Scholfield had been expected to partner Paul Nicholls-trained Sam Winner in the £1million race .
But the champion trainer said on Wednesday it was unfair to tie him down to a gelding which is far from certain to run .
