Angela Merkel called for a new European Union system that distributes asylum-seekers to member states based on their population and economic strength .
The call comes as Europe struggles with the growing refugee crisis in the Mediterranean, where hundreds have died trying to get from northern Africa to Italy .
David Cameron insisted at an emergency EU summit on Thursday that the UK would not take any of the refugees because it was already doing its part by virtue of having the continent's largest aid and defence budgets .
