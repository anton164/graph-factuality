BAE System's Typhoon can take off in less than 8 seconds and reach altitudes of 36,000 feet Mach 1.6 in under two and a half minutes .
It is powered by two Eurojet EJ200 engines, which measure 59ft (15 metres) long and 9.8ft (3 metres) thick .
This helps its ‘fly by wire’ computer system to accurately control the aircraft, designed to be unstable but hugely agile .
