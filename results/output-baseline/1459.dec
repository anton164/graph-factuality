Self-styled 'anarchist libertarian' squatters have set up camp in one of London's most historic monuments .
They unfurled banners reading 'Homes for all' and 'respect existence or expect resistance' as masked demonstrators sat with their legs dangling over the side of the Grade-I listed building .
A garbled message posted on Facebook by the group simply calls for 'Christmas lights... any and all radical/revolutionary messages'
