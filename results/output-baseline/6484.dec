Roger Byng, 67, from Bristol, was in a hide in Slimbridge, Gloucester .
He spotted the fox sprinting across the grass towards the large Canadian goose .
But the fox only came away with a single feather, while the goose escaped with a squawk .
Mr Byng said: 'The fox came so close to what surely would be a grand catch for an animal'
