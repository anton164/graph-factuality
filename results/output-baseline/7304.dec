Homes in China are known as 'dingzihu' or 'nail houses' because they stick out and are difficult to remove, like a stubborn nail house .
They are often left standing after their owners refuse to give in to property developers vying for their demolition .
One house in Wenling, Zhejiang province, had a main road built around it when the owner refused to move .
