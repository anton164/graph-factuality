Dana Perino was accompanying the former president as he visited wounded soldiers and their families at the Walter Reed hospital in Washington, D.C.
Perino said Bush 'just stood and took it' when the mother screamed at him, wanting to know why it was her child and not his who lay in that hospital bed .
She said Bush tried to calm her and that at first, the mother's husband tried to offer the mother some words of comfort before he just 'stand and take it'
