The 'goblins' are scientifically known as 'hoodoos' - rock protrusions .
They have been created by gradual erosion of Entrada sandstone over millions of years .
The softer rock has been removed by wind and water, leaving thousands of unique constructions, which are further chiselled by water and dust erosion .
