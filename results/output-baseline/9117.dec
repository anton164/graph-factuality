Justice Anthony Kennedy has been marching in this direction since his most recent gay rights decision in 2013 .
He deplored that the U.S. law for making gay marriage 'unequal' was an endorsement of it and began invalidating state bans on state bans .
The majority of Americans now support gay marriage .
Chief Justice John Roberts voted against gay marriage in 2012 .
