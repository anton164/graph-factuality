Scientists at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School have developed a device that clips onto the camera of a smartphone .
It uses the powerful cameras available on most smartphones in combination with tiny beads that bind to cancerous cells .
These beads alter the way light passes through it, changing the way the light is scattered by the sample .
They can then be sent to a central computer for analysis and analysis .
Each test costs around Â£1.20 ($1.80) and the results are returned within two minutes .
