Virtual studio DesignCrowd invited people to submit images of some of the most well-known cities in the world .
DesignCrowd asked people to upload before and after graphics of the world would be sent back to them .
The images were then sent to a virtual studio in nearly every London tourist shop .
A number of the images have been created, including the Arc de Triomphe and the Tower Bridge .
