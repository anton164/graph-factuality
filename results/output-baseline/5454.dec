Pupils applying to Cambridge University may have to take an entrance test next year for the first time in almost 30 years .
At present, the university uses unified mark scheme (UMS) scores calculated from students' performance in their AS-levels .
Under coalition reforms, AS exams will be optional for cohorts starting this September and scores will no longer contribute to overall A-level .
