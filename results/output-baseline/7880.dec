West Indies cricket legend Sir Curtly Ambrose was one of the West Indies stars who accompanied Stanford when he flew to the Lord's nursery ground in 2008 .
Stanford's deal with England ended with his arrest and 110-year jail sentence, just one $20million T20 game into the contract .
The ECB president Giles Clarke did not want to discuss the Stanford legacy saying it was a long time ago .
