Three Syrian men arrested for allegedly being part of the crew at the helm of a Turkish-flagged yacht .
The yacht was flying from north Africa to Europe with a 'cargo' of â‚¬8,500 .
It was stopped as it approached the Italian coast and was stopped by two merchant ships .
This is far more than the usual cost of a boat to cross the Mediterranean to Europe .
