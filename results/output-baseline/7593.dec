Joan Cheever, the founder of The Chow Train non-profit, served hot meals out of her personal pickup truck because it is more maneuverable .
Cheever was issued a citation and a $2,000 fine for failing to serve food out of a licensed food truck .
The fine has done nothing to deter Cheever from continuing distributing free food to the city's poor .
