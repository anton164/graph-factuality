The system uses high-definition cameras and interactive toys to let patients play with abandoned animals at the Jacksonville Humane Society shelter .
Children can control three different cat toys at the shelter with the push of a button .
The toys include a long 'tail' that swings from side to side when the user presses a button, and then watch on the TV as the animals react and play with them .
