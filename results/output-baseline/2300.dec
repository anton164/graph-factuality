Me-Bai was sold to provide rides for tourists in Thailand when she was three-and-a-half years old and didn't see her mother for three years .
After a 62-mile (100km) trek through the Thai jungle, she was rescued and brought to the Elephant Nature Park sanctuary in the north of Thailand .
The small elephant can be seen nuzzling her mother, while the pair joyfully flap their ears and caress each other with their trunks .
