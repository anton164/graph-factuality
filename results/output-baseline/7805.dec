Hanan, 19, was snatched from her family in Mosul, Iraq, last August .
She was taken to a warehouse in a nearby village where hundreds of women were lined up and hand picked by ISIS militants .
They were then taken to another village where they met a fellow Yazidi girl who had been incarcerated there for the last two months .
Hanan escaped with some of the other girls by jumping out of a window, but two of them were caught as they fled .
