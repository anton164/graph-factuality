The Yellowstone supervolcano releases 45,000 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide each day .
This is so large its partly-molten rock could fill the Grand Canyon 11 times over .
Previous research found a relatively small magma chamber, known as the upper-crustal magma reservoir, directly beneath the surface .
It sits 12 to 28 miles (19 to 45km) below the surface and measures 11,035 cubic miles (46,000 cubic km)
