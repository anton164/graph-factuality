Lorraine Bracco turned down the role of Dr. Jennifer Melfi in The Sopranos because she had already played a mobster's wife in Goodfellas nine years previously .
Bracco said she fell in love with David Chase the minute she met him .
He cast Edie Falco instead as Dr. Melfi, who provided the therapy that allowed him to justify many of his monstrous acts .
'I really don't think I'll bring so much to this for you that I haven't done already,' Bracco said .
