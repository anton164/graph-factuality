The Project were promoting their upcoming interview with US comedian Michael Che .
Che and Jay Pharoah are in Australia to perform a string of shows at Melbourneâ€™s International Comedy Festival .
However, in a cringeworthy gaffe, two of the three clips were of Che's castmate, JayPharoah .
The show was later flagged up by gobsmacked Twitter users .
