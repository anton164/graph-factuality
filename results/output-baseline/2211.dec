Officer Jeffrey Swett was allegedly run over by William Bogard in January after the suspect stole his car while it was running .
Bogard was able to get into his car without resistance because the officer was investigating reports about the suspect breaking into a house and threatening to kill the occupants .
The hearing was held so a judge could determine if there is substantial evidence for a trial .
