Astronauts Barry Wilmore and Terry Virts recorded three spacewalks outside the International Space Station on February 25 and March 1 .
They set up antennas and routed 4000 feet (1219m) of power and data cables .
The clip was recorded to give the future ISS workers an idea of what they can expect when they go into space to maintain the commercial spacecraft .
