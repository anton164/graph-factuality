78 Irish travellers, who hail from just four families, refused to budge despite facing three courts, a planning inquiry and a council inquiry .
But locals in Hardhorn, Lancashire, accused the group of trashing their leafy village .
They claimed the eviction 'violated' the human rights of 39 children living on the site in 60 caravans .
Last October, the travellers were told to move out by the Court of Appeal last October .
