At least 112,000 motorists were given fines or appeared in court for motorway offences last year – a quarter more than in the previous year .
The increase has been put down to the introduction of ‘smart motorways’ which use the cameras, known as Hadecs .
This means many drivers are being given the minimum £100 fines despite driving under the national motorway speed limit of 70mph .
