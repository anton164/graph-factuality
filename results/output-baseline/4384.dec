Vincent Lamouroux painted the derelict motel in LA's Silver Lake neighborhood .
He used an environmentally friendly limewash to coat the entire property .
It instantly became a hit with passers-by who stopped to take photos .
The project will be guarded for two weeks before the weather and graffiti artists reclaim the building .
