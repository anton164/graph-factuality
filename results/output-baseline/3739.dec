Astronomers have used a telescope in New Mexico to watch a star take shape over eight years apart .
Images were taken by the Karl Gansky Very Large Array in 1996 and the second by the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) last year .
The images were created by data from 27 radio telescope antennae in the New Mexico desert in the U.S.
