Andy Murray and Amelie Mauresmo will take a prolonged break from each other after Wimbledon .
Murray parted company with Ivan Lendl last year because the Czech was no longer able to spend half the year travelling to the US .
Mauresmo is expected to be replaced by Swede Jonas Bjorkman in the lead-up to US Open .
