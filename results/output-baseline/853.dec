Scientists from the University of Milan and University of Colorado Boulder say they have evidence that DNA-like fragments may have come with 'instructions' that guided their growth into complex life forms 4 billion years ago .
They say the self-assembly of DNA fragments just a few nanometres in length have the ability to drive the formation of chemical bonds long enough to evolve into primitive life .
