Erica Ann Ginneti, 35, a married mother of three from Philadelphia, pleaded guilty in December to institutional sexual assault and disseminating sexually explicit material to a minor .
Ginneti was referred to as 'dangling candy' by Judge Garrett D. Page, who also reportedly asked 'What young man would not jump on that candy?' before sentencing her to 30 days in jail and the next 60 on house arrest .
