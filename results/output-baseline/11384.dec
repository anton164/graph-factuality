Asabi Barner, 37, is suing Harlem tattoo parlor Black Ink for a chest piece that left her disfigured and in pain .
She went to the parlor last year to get a new tattoo to cover up a unicorn and horseshoe piece that she got when she was 18 years old .
The tattoo started to puss and ooze in the area around her left breast .
