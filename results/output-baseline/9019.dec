Progress M-27M appears to have suffered a major malfunction moments after launch at 3:09 am EDT (07:09 GMT)
It was due to dock with the ISS six hours after take off, but that plan has now been 'indefinitely abandoned'
Nasa's Mission Control reported that a video camera on Progress showed it to be spinning at a 'rather significant rate'
