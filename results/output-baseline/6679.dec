New training will commence at Los Angeles International Airport, one of the airports named in the complaint filed by the American Civil Liberties Union .
The complaint was filed on behalf of Malaika Singleton, who said she was subjected to a hair pat-down with weeks of each other while traveling from LA to London in December 2013 .
Singleton's hair was styled in tightly-wound 'sisterlocks' and proceeded to 'squeeze it from top to bottom' at LAX airport .
