Belinda Bartholomew claims she was racially abused at a Bondi butcher in Sydney's eastern suburbs on Monday night .
She says she was called names and told to go to 'an Aussie butcher' when she tried to change her chicken selection .
But the butcher who was working at Sam the Butcher in Bondi has hit back saying he is 'lying' and trying to ruin the business .
