Eric Coins, who was drinking in the city of Sunrise, Florida, posted the video to YouTube accusing the man of wearing the uniform to get free drinks and meet women .
In the video, Coins tells the man: 'Do you know where infantry camp is? It's in Fort Benning, Georgia'
The young man then asks the man if he is in the army - but the young man replies 'no'
He then asks if he's a cop, before asking if he has a Geneva Conventions Identification Card .
