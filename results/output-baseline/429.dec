New Zealand photographer Amos Chapple travelled the world with a quadcopter in his backpack between 2012 and 2014 .
He travelled across Europe during the 18 months when it was easier to take aerial pictures using drones .
Mr Chapple has re-posted the images under a new blog under his new blog 'My Aerial Drone Shots Would Be Totally Illegal Today'
