ISIS entered the Yarmouk camp as Jordan closed its only functioning border crossing with the country following clashes between rebels and government forces .
The militants entered the camp from Hajar Aswad neighborhood in southern Damascus in a coordinated attack with their rivals in the Al Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front .
If ISIS manage to gain full control of the camp, the jihadis can potentially use the camp as a base from which to threaten Assad himself .
