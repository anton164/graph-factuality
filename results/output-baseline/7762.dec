Comedian Sarah Silverman claimed she was paid less than her male counterpart Todd Barry for a piece she did for Levo League .
But Silverman has since apologized and revealed she fabricated the story to highlight the gender pay gap .
She said Silverman had been paid less because she appeared as a guest on the show and wasn't meant to receive anything .
