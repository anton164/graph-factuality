Moussa Sissoko was sent off for a second bookable offence during Newcastle's 2-0 defeat at Liverpool on Sunday night .
Sissoko's tackle on Lucas was 'indefensible', says John Carver .
The Newcastle boss said Sissou could have been shown a straight red .
Carver also said that Ayoze Perez did not earn a penalty after being felled by Dejan Lovren .
