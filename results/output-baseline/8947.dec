Rupa Huq, who is standing for Ed Miliband’s party in a key marginal seat in west London, said fellow candidates who turned down the cash were ‘sticking their noses up’ at Mr Blair .
Mr Blair made £1,000 donations to 106 local campaigns in target seats across the country in March, only for some Labour candidates to reject the cash .
Ms Huq is the sister of former Blue Peter presenter Konnie Huq .
