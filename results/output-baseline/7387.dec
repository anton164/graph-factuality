The I'm Up Alarm can be set to go off the night before and will only turn off if you physically get out of bed and scan a barcode on a mug or magnet .
The app uses a Quick Response code, or QR code, which is a form of barcode that can be printed on your favourite mug or magnets .
Mr Smagon is currently seeking funding from Kickstarter to test the app .
