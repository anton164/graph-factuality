Archbishop of Brisbane Phillip Aspinall said he supported the Homosexual Advance Defence Defence to be scrapped from Queensland common law .
The defence means a murder charge may be reduced to manslaughter if the defendant establishes their victim 'came on' to them, and the killing was in self-defence .
'When people feel threatened, there is a natural human tendency to react out of fear,' he said .
