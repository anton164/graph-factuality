Islamic State militants released photos showing crates of American-produced Halal chicken being set alight in a field near the city of Aleppo .
The meat was being burned after the jihadis noticed labels on the boxes suggested the birds had been reared and slaughtered in the U.S.
The images were released by the Islamic State's official propaganda wing in Aleppo province, which the militants consider so beyond the pale that hungry refugees are banned from eating the meat .
