The UCO Stormproof Matches are made using an incredibly tough coating that smoulders no matter what happens to them .
The matches have to go through rigorous testing to make sure they keep alight in even the most difficult situations .
Even when buried in sand, the matches can burn again once they are taken out and exposed to oxygen .
