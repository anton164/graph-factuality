Adam Johnson was charged with three offences of sexual activity with a child under 16 and one of grooming on Thursday .
The 27-year-old has been used as a substitute in the last three games for Sunderland .
Sunderland manager Dick Advocaat insists it was not a difficult decision to include Johnson in his squad for Saturday's Premier League trip to Stoke .
Johnson is due to appear at Peterlee Magistrates' Court on May 20 .
