All of the 36 units at Redlands House sheltered accommodation have been given the colourful treatment .
Pensioner Graham White, 76, said the colour scheme has made it look 'more like a children's playscheme than sheltered accommodation'
He said the colours were chosen to help those with poor eyesight find their way home .
