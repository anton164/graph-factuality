Liam Dawe, 21, died from 'intra-abdominal sepsis' in March last year .
He was shaken at just four weeks old as a four-week-old .
Inquest heard he was shaken as a result of an injury to the brain .
His injuries were caused in 1993 before the rules came into force .
A senior officer at Derriford Hospital in Plymouth said the law changed in 1996 that meant an act was presumed not to have caused a person's death if it happened more than a year before .
