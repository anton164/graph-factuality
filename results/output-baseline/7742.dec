A grand jury charged Robert Durst with possession of a firearm by a felon, and possession of both a firearm and an illegal drug: 5 ounces of marijuana .
Durst was arrested early March 15 on the Los Angeles warrant and escorted to his hotel room .
He was arrested separately on the weapons charges the next day the day before the final HBO episode aired of The Jinx: The Life And Deaths Of Robert Durstan .
Durst's attorneys say his Asperger's Syndrome led him to erroneously trust HBO producers, who screened semi-confessional interviews that will now be used against him .
