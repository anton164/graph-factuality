David Billing, 48, had to have part of his tongue removed after he was diagnosed with mouth cancer .
Surgeons saw through his jawbone and removed part of Mr Billing's arm .
The only drawback is that it still has hairs on it .
Mr Billing said being told he had cancer was 'mind-blowing' and a 'real low point'
