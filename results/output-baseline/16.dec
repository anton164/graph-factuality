Author Martin Fletcher claims the devastating fire was not started deliberately and was caused by a discarded cigarette .
He spent 15 years researching the tragedy in which his brother Andrew, 11, his father John, 34, and grandfather Eddie, 63, were all killed .
The fire broke out near half-time of Bradford's Valley Parade on May 11, 1985 .
It was thought to have been started by a cigarette dropped through a gap in the wooden frame of the main stand on to piles of rubbish which had been collecting for years .
