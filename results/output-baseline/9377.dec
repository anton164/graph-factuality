Researchers from London and Edinburgh have developed a computer that can collate meterological information and then produce forecasts as if they were written by a human .
It uses a process known as 'natural language generation' (NLG)
These computer-generated weather updates are being tested by scientists at Heriot-Watt University and University College London .
Using Met Office data, the researchers are developing new algorithms for automatically generating weather forecasts .
