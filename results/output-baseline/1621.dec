David Watson, a 46-year-old Tucson firefighter, was arrested Saturday on charges he killed his ex-wife Linda Watson, 35, in what detectives say was motivated by a custody dispute over their daughter Jordynn .
Police say the dispute continued after Watson's murder as her mother Marilyn Cox, 63, tried to gain visitation rights over the girl in 2003 .
Watson has been charged in all three murders, with police cited DNA evidence .
