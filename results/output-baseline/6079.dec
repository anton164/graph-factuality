Walter Scott was jailed in 1987 for shouting obscenities at a man and pushing a deputy .
Scott suffered a cut and was treated at a local hospital before being transported to the jail .
His family believe the fear of being thrown back in prison was the reason he tried to flee during a traffic stop last year .
A lawsuit is being filed against Michael Slager stemming from his time on the North Charleston Police Department .
