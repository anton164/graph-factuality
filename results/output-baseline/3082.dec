John Shipton's two-bedroom home at 36 Kent Street, Newtown, was first put on the market for at least $1.1 million, but failed to sell in an initial auction in mid-March .
The quirky home was built in the 1870s as the servant's quarters to a Victorian villa next door and was last bought by his partner in 1989 for $130,000 .
