Five of Slager's fellow officers responded to his call for back-up after the shooting .
The fact that his wounds were to the back do not feature in subsequent accounts of the shooting has been questioned .
One officer was also present when Slager picked up an object - allegedly his Taser - and put it near Scott's body .
Slager's father said: 'They would have swept it under the rug like they did with many others'
