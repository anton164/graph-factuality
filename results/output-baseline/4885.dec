Esa's Rosetta spacecraft has captured stunning images of a dust jet erupting from comet 67P Churyumov-Gerasimenko .
It is unusual because so far such activity has only been seen on the day-side of the comet - not the night-side so far .
But it's not clear if this was caused by a wave of heat reaching ice trapped under the surface, causing an explosion of material .
