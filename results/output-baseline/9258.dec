More than 100 tonnes of dead fish found floating in the water near Huizhou City in southern China .
Workers had rushed to clear the lake using plastic baskets and nets .
The lake had been turned into a commercial fish farm in 1996 by owner Zhang Feng .
He claims the ammonia came from a nearby farm which had been using the chemical as fertiliser .
