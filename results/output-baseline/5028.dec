Two TSA employees allegedly worked as a team to manipulate the results of a full body scanner at a security check-point in Denver last year .
The TSA received an anonymous tip-off that an employee had admitted to 'groping' male passengers he found attractive .
A TSA supervisor told police that he saw the male employee 'give a signal' and then perform pat downs of the male passenger's genitals .
Both employees were fired following the incident .
