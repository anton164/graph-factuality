British-born street artist Plastic Jesus put up seven 'NO Kardashian Parking Anytime' signs around LA this week .
He says he came up with the idea while driving down Melrose Avenue in L.A. a few weeks ago when traffic was brought to a standstill because of a Kardashian shopping cart .
Plastic Jesus says the signs are intended to draw attention to the obsession with reality TV stars .
