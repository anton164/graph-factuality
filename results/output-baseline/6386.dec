Poster, from Protein World, was posted on the London Underground .
It featured a genetically-blessed model in a bikini asking: 'Are you beach body ready?'
But online pranksters have now recreated the advert with curvy alternatives .
Dove said the advert was not created by Dove but a Dove spokesperson .
The advert is being displayed at London's Knightsbridge Tube station .
