Caleb Benn, a California high school student, recently developed a $4.99 (Â£3.24) app for iOS devices using Instagram's application program interface interface .
The app allows users to upload photos to Instagram directly from their computer rather than using their smartphone .
An engineer from Facebook, which owns Instagram, sent Benn an email last week claiming the app violated the company's terms of service .
