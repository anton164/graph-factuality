Researchers at the University of Bristol found that having 'one large glass of wine' increases 'facial flushing' and confidence .
They quizzed 40 students and asked them to rate the attractiveness of three groups of people who were sober, tipsy and drunk .
But too much booze led to 'changes in facial expressions which were excessive and unattractive'
The study is the first time it has been shown that the drinker themselves actually 'becomes more attractive' to others .
