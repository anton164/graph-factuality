Audrey Dimitrew, 16, of Virginia accepted a spot on the under-16 Chantilly Juniors club in November believing she would get playing time .
She was benched the first two tournaments of the season and was told her skills were not up to par to compete with her team .
Her mother Susan said the dispute is not about playing time but about 'playing' claiming her daughter 'wants to play'
