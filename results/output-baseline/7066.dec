Researchers at Purdue University in Indiana were investigating how to reduce collisions by keeping birds away from planes .
They found that birds responded most to blue lights on planes and were more alert when the lights were on .
When the plane approached them with its lights off, the birds became alert more quickly .
The study was published in the Condor: Ornithological Applications .
It said runways could be synced with taxiing aircraft to alert birds to incoming planes and avoid collisions .
