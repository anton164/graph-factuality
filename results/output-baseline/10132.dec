Jack Black the friendly jackdaw has become so well-loved in Penryn, Cornwall, that one fan has set up a Facebook page for him .
He often pops into peopleâ€™s houses, goes with them on the weekly shop and has even joined them for Christmas dinner .
Jack was hand-reared as a chick after being discovered with no feathers, before being released into the wild .
