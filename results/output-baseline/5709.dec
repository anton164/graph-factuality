Davion Navar Henry Only, 16, had spent his entire life in foster care after his mother gave birth to him behind bars .
He made a plea for a family to 'love him forever' at St Mark Missionary Baptist Church in St Petersburg, Florida .
When he was seven-years-old, Davion stood before his old caseworker Connie Bell Going .
Going took the steps to begin the adoption process and Davion moved with the rest of the family into a larger home .
