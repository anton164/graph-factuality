The video depicts the 918 Spyder clocking 350km/h as it rockets down a dead-straight stretch of road on the Stuart Highway, north of Alice Springs .
The car was driven by New Zealand professional race car driver Craig Baird, who switches the vehicle into ‘Race Hybrid’ and slams his foot on the throttle when they reach the unrestricted zone in a mere 40 seconds .
Porsche used radios and spotters to ensure the road was completely empty at the time .
