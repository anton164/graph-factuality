Aidan Fraley, 16, says Robert Bates, 73, should have been deputized and given a gun .
Bates has said he mistakenly pulled out a handgun rather than a stun gun when he fatally shot Eric Harris on April 2 as he lay on the ground .
His mother, who calls Harris her 'soulmate' since the shooting, has already forgiven him for his actions .
