Alice Barker, 102, snapped her fingers and sang along as videos of her routines as a chorus line dancer during the 1930s Harlem Renaissance .
She had danced at legendary clubs like the Apollo, Cotton Club and Zanzibar Club .
Her videos were filed under 'Baker', a misspelling of her name - which was why no one had been able to find them before .
