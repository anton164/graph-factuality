The plot where Lizzie Borden and her family were buried was vandalized on Monday .
Borden went on trial for brutally murdering her father and stepmother with a hatchet in their Fall River, Massachusetts home in 1892 .
The murder and trial inspired the schoolyard rhyme: 'When she saw what she had done, she gave her father 41'
