German photographer Dieter Klein travelled the world for six years searching for vintage cars left to crumble in leafy forests and fields .
Many of the cars, often with doors, tires or windows missing, are parked on forest floors where nature has taken them over .
Dieter found a rare Jaguar XK120, which could fetch Â£82,000 if restored .
