Homaro Cantu, 38, was found dead inside Crooked Fork Brewery, the brewpub he was planning to open with his business partner on the north side of Chicago .
Cantu was a pioneer in molecular gastronomy, which he said co-medicated funds to keep his other business afloat .
Last month, an investor in Moto and iNG accused Cantu of co-mingling funds from Moto to keep iNG afloat .
