Gaby Tillero and Greg Ensslen bought the two-story 1840s Creole cottage from the Central City neighborhood after a church said they wanted to demolish it and expand their parking lot .
The couple then moved it to the Freret neighborhood where they renovated it while respecting the original floor plan and used salvaged materials to decorate the home .
Tillero and Ennslen now live in the home with their two sons, six-year-old Santiago and nine-year old Javier, as well as Tillero's mother .
