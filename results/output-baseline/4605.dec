South Glasgow University Hospital opened today with a fleet of robots delivering linen, a children's cinema and helicopter landing pad .
Ukip leader Nicola Sturgeon said the building proved SNP's commitment to the NHS .
But Ukip said the hospital had been funded with English taxpayers' money 'shovelled' to Holyrood despite gaping holes in hospital funding south of the border .
