Researchers at University College London made the disovery after creating a simulation of how the virus spread from HIV to AIDS in a major clinical trial .
They worked together to build a model for this ‘hybrid spreading’ which accurately predicted patients’ progression .
The model was inspired by similarities between HIV and computer worms such as the Conficker worm, first detected in 2008 .
