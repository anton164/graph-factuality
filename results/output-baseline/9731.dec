Alfred Hitchcock was born in Leytonstone, East London, the son of a wholesale grocer .
His entire oeuvre was a study of voyeurism, violence and guilt .
Hitchcock was never any oil painting, he was the neurotic fat boy with piggy eyes, who was filled with 'lavish and peculiar' repressed sexual fantasies .
