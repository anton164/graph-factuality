Researchers at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse have warned that Bikram yoga raises the risk of heat stroke .
They found that a typical session lasts for 90 minutes and is performed in a room heated to 40°C (105°F) with 40 per cent humidity .
The average body temperature for men was 39°C, while seven volunteers' temperature reached 39°F (103°F), for women .
Scientists advise that the standard 90-minute class is reduced to just an hour to reduce risk .
