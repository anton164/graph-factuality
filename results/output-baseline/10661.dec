The woolly mammoth became extinct as a result of osteoporosis and being hunted to extinction by early man .
It was previously thought that the mammoth simply died out from post-Ice Age climate change .
But new evidence was uncovered by Dr Sergey Leshchinsky, from Tomsk State University .
He spent a decade analysing bone and teeth samples from mammoths that roamed western Europe and Russia between 10,000 and 30,000 years ago .
