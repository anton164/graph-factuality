Randy Linn, now in a California federal prison where he's two years into his 20-year sentence, said that he can't believe that he tried to destroy a place of worship .
Federal prosecutors said Linn drove about two hours from his home in St. Joe, Indiana, to the Islamic Center of Greater Toledo in September 2012, and poured gasoline on a prayer rug and set it on fire .
Linn later said while pleading guilty to hate crime charges that he'd become enraged after seeing images of wounded soldiers in the news and decided to burn the mosque .
