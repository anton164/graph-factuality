Robert Durst, 72, was arrested at a hotel in the New Orleans capital in March a day before the finale of HBO docu-series The Jinx .
He was arrested for the murder of his friend Susan Berman in 2000, which some believe he may have committed to stop her talking to authorities about the disappearance of his wife .
Durst, who faces a murder charge in an unrelated California case, will now face federal charges, which lawyers believe he can win .
