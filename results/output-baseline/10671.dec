Louise Shepherd, 31, was hiking through the Madidi national park in Bolivia .
She had taken a 'gap year' off work in order to go travelling around the world .
A tree toppled onto her during a storm and she was crushed by the fall .
Her parents said they were left having to choose a burial plot instead of planning for her birthday .
