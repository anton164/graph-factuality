Oil painting was believed to be the work of a follower of 16th century renaissance master El Greco .
It was bought by the owner's late father in the 1970s for very little .
But the sale price suggests it may have been done by the artist himself .
Auctioneer Richard Bromell gave the painting an estimated value of between £300 and £400 .
