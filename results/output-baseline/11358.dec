The 103-year-old deckchair was found bobbing on the Atlantic by the crew of the Mackay-Bennett .
It was on the first class promenade deck when the liner sank after hitting an iceberg on its maiden voyage in 1912 .
The ship's log records six or seven deckchairs being picked up and taken back to port in Nova Scotia .
One was given by a crew member to Captain Julien Lemarteleur, who had previously worked on board the Titanic .
