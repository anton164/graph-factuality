Ellie, 10, and Taylor Biggin, 5, lost their brother Harvey last year .
When Easter approached they decided to donate all their eggs to Sheffield Children's Hospital .
They donated eggs - and now the eggs will be donated to the hospital .
The eggs are still coming in from as far afield as the US and Ireland .
