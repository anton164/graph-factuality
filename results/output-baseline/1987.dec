Sisters Sophie Morgan, 25, and Sheree Morgan, 21, allowed their bank accounts to be used to accept thousands of pounds in stolen money .
They were conned out of over £36,000 over the phone by a fraudster posing as a police detective .
The couple, from Nelson, Lancashire, allowed £17,500 to be put into their accounts .
But the fraudster who made the calls was 'extremely well spoken' and 'sounded as though he knew what he was talking about'
