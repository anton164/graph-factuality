Fossils from an extinct pygmy sperm whale that died seven million years ago have shed new light on the evolution of modern day whales .
The skulls of two individuals were unearthed at a sea cliff along the Caribbean coast of Panama .
They indicate that the bone involved in sound generation and echolocation got smaller throughout the whaleâ€™s evolution .
In contrast modern sperm whales are much larger than their extinct relatives .
