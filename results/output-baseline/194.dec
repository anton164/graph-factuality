Cameron Hooker, 61, was handed 104-year sentence in 1985 for kidnap, torture and rape of Colleen Stan, 20, in 1977 .
Stan was known as 'The Girl in the Box' after it was revealed that she was forced into a coffin-like structure for 23 hours a day during much of her captivity .
But he was allowed to request parole seven years earlier than under normal rules .
California has introduced the Elderly Parole Program which allows a parole hearing from inmates older than 60 who have served at least 25 years .
