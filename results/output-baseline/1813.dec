A monster crocodile has been caught devouring a one metre long lizard at a river in Northern Territory .
The three-metre reptile swallowed the water monitor whole, which is a type of goanna .
It took three members of the croc management team and local police to get the reptile out of the trap .
A trap was set up a week before the crocodile was caught last month after it had been eating dogs and threatening locals .
