MarÃ­a Jose Carrascosa, 49, was paroled last year after moving her daughter, then 5, to Spain when the girl's father, Peter Innes, was granted custody of the child .
Carrascosa defiantly refused to return her daughter to the United States and thus remained jailed for nearly nine years .
Her release came after her daughter and estranged husband wrote letters to the court urging a judge to set her free .
