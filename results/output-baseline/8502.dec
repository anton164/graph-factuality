The goose at first appeared to make it through the arrow removal operation at a bird and wildlife clinic Wednesday but then died a short time later .
Animal officials had high hopes for the bird's recovery after it was shot intentionally at least a week ago .
A worker at the Anaheim Hills Car Wash befriended the goose several days ago by feeding it bread crumbs and was able to catch it and turn it over .
