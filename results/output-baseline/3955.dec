Michael Phelps is aiming to compete in a fifth Olympics next year in Rio .
The 18-time Olympic champion will be competing in his first meet since serving a six-month suspension by USA Swimming after a second drunken driving arrest last fall .
Phelps said he won't be swimming at the world championships in Russia in August as part of the punishment set forth by the sport's U.S. governing body .
