Fire boat Massey Shaw was requisitioned from the London Fire Brigade in 1940 and transported to Dunkirk to help with evacuation of Allied troops .
The boat is still capable of pumping out 3,000 gallons of water every minute - as much as four fire engines - despite being 80 years old .
Volunteers are now hoping to transport the Massey back to the shores of Dunkirk next month .
