Robert Gentile appeared in federal court in Hartford, Connecticut on Friday and was charged with selling a firearm to an undercover agent .
The 78-year-old was arrested on a gun charge, but his lawyer claimed the arrest was a ruse to pressure Gentile to speak about the $500million art heist .
Gentile has denied any knowledge of the theft and the missing work is believed to be the only seascape he has ever owned .
