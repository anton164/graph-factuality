Brett and Naghmeh King took Ashya King to Prague for proton beam therapy .
The five-year-old's parents were forced to flee to Spain with him before he had surgery to remove the tumour .
Mr King said he received a letter from a person who said they wished his children got cancer and died .
But the family now say there is 'no evidence' of a tumour in Ashya's brain .
