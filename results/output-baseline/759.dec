Scientists from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, Switzerland, used a robot to interfere with the sensory signals in the brains of blindfolded volunteers .
The experiment was carried out using a robotic device that reproduced their movements and touched them on the back of their ears .
When the researchers introduced a temporal delay of just a few milliseconds, the distorting of temporal and spatial perception induced the 'ghostly' feeling .
