Kim Copeland, 52, was walking home from Sainsbury's in Coventry .
Council officers came 'sprinting' towards her to say she had committed a criminal offence .
But she refused to pay in ten days in protest at how she was treated .
She was then issued with a Â£50 fixed penalty notice following the incident .
