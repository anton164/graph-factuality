Scientists at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem studied the cephlopods movement .
They used high speed videos of octopuses as they negotiated obstacles .
The orientation of the creature's body and the crawling direction are controlled independently in the brain .
It is the first time scientists have been able to fully understand how the creatures are able to control their movements without a rigid skeleton .
