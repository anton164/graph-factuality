Anti-racism protester Jacob King was snapped staring into the eyes of a bald man with a swastika tattoo .
Mr King said he had his arms spread out because he thought the man was going to attack him and his group were going to be violent .
He said he learned Islamophobic views from a young age but thankfully managed to 'unlearn' these views .
