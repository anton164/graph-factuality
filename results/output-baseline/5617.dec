The event happened in an ancient cluster of stars at the edge of the Milky Way galaxy .
When a star reaches its white dwarf stage, nearly all material from the star is packed inside a radius one hundredth that of the original star .
This means the gravitational pull of the star and tides, caused by the difference in gravity's pull on the near and far side of the planet, are greatly enhanced .
