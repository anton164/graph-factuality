The converted four-bedroom home on Lawrenny Court was built as a garage to service the generous 57-room mansion Homeden .
It was originally a garage and chauffeur's residence that would have been home to Supreme Court Justice Sir Henry Hodges .
The doors of the 'breathtaking' property have not yet been opened to potential buyers .
