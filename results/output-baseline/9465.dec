The Boy Scouts' Greater New York Councils said they hired Pascal Tessier, an 18-year-old Eagle Scout who has been a vocal advocate of open the organization .
Tessier's hiring is in contrast to the national scouting organization's ban on openly gay adult members .
The National organization changed its policy in 2013 to allow openly gay kids as scouts, but not adults as leaders .
