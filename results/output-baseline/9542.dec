The seven-car Maglev hit a top speed of 375mph (603km/h) during a test run near Mount Fuji .
It beat last week's record of 366mph (590kph) which was set by the UK's HS2 .
The technology promises a ride that's smoother, quieter and almost twice as fast as traditional high-speed rail .
Maglev trains are expected to link Tokyo and Osaka in just 67 minutes .
