Qantas uniforms worn by Qantas' domestic and international pilots have not been changed for more than a decade .
A key focus of the redesign will be the female uniform, with the uniforms expected to be rolled out next year .
Mr Grant will spend time talking to pilots, travelling with them and sitting in a flight simulator before he begins designing the uniforms .
