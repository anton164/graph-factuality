Tony Blair made an appearance at a low-key private fundraising dinner for 15 Labour target seats .
But despite the fact that Blair has a record of three general election victories, only one Shadow Cabinet minister, Chuka Umunna, could be bothered to attend .
Blair name-checked Ed Miliband only once, devoting his speech instead to his own achievements .
