NBC handed Williams a six-month suspension in February after he admitted he lied about being on a Chinook that came under fire while reporting from Iraq in 2003 .

On one occasion, Williams implied they had both been in Berlin together on the day the wall fell in 1989 - but he actually joined him the following day .
