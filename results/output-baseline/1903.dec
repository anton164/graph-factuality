Researchers from Taiwan studied the expression of a class of genes known as the lip .
They found the shape is determined by two competing groups of proteins .
These proteins can compete to promote the formation of the lip and standard petals in two orchid species by reducing the activity of the L complex using gene silencing .
The study extends scientists' understanding of the mechanisms leading to the beauty of orchid flowers .
