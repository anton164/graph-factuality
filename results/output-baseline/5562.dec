Keepers at Columbus Zoo say ten-year-old Irisa had mated before but never conceived .
But Irisa failed to show any maternal care so her offspring are now being hand-reared in an incubator .
This is the third litter sired by ten year-old female, Irisa since 2012 .
The baby cats currently weigh 2.5lbs but are set to grow to a heftier 650lbs .
