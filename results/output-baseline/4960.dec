The last woolly mammoths were isolated on an Arctic island for around 5,000 years, forcing them to inbreed as their population dwindled until disapperance 4,500 years ago .
Researchers have concluded that the creatures clung on in just a tiny pocket of the Arctic, on an island that appears to have become cut off from mainland .
The study has also raised the prospect of bringing the giant mammal back to life using cloning techniques with modern elephants .
