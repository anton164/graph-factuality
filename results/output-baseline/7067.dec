Images show a shoal of fish making way for a blacktip shark off Heron Island in Queensland, Australia .
It is thought the reef shark was not interested in catching a meal, but the fish naturally keep their distance, creating circles of clear water around the shark .
The fish are thought to gain many benefits from shoaling behaviour, such as keeping safe from predators .
