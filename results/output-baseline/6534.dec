Charles Kingham, 86, and partner Pauline Moore, 68, have been together for 40 years .
They bought their home in Mablethorpe in 1987 for Â£35,000 .
But it became a 'living hell' after it was converted into an integrated offender management centre .
The couple have been forced to board up every window for protection .
Mr Kingham said: 'This house was a dream home but our life has been made a living'
