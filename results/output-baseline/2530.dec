Michelle Carter, 18, appeared in court in New Bedford, Massachusetts on Thursday accused of encouraging the death of her friend, Conrad Roy III, who gassed himself in his truck in Fairhaven last July .
Carter's defense attorney requested the case be moved out of Bristol County because the district attorney is the victim's third cousin .
The district attorney's office filed a response arguing that the DA, Thomas Quinn, has excused himself from any involvement in the case .
