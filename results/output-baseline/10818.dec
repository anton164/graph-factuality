Dominika Petrinova, 27, was furious after her boyfriend Erik Meldik, 31, posted a video of his dog Sam in a washing machine .
She then glued wax strips to a plastic office chair - naked and blindfolded .
He then pulled himself off the chair, leaving a fair portion of skin behind in the process .
Mr Meldrik, from the Czech Republic, said: 'Are you kidding me? You're pranking me now?'
