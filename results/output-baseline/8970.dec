Scientists at the University of Connecticut say we know how far away the source of a sound is by listening to the echoes it produces .
In a study they found that the reverberation of sound helps us locate the distance of a car passing a bend or a person nearby .
They used tiny microphones to record the sounds inside a car and recorded them inside a person's ears .
