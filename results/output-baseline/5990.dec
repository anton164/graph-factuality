Mother and ten ducklings tried to cross busy high street in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands .
But they didn't bargain for the ducks following them back to the office .
Ducklings swaddled into a nearby park and drank from the water bowl .
They then disappeared into the nearby park where they stayed for an hour .
