Researchers from the University of Patras took thermal infrared photographs of 41 volunteers’ faces, before and after drinking four glasses of wine .
They found that the temperature of the forehead and nose is the best indication of a person’s drunken state .
The scientists then used artificial neural networks to compare the sober and drunken images pixel-by-pixel .
It is the first time the technology could be installed in cars to spot drink drivers and stop them starting the ignition .
