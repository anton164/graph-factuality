Douglas Murphy, 47, was cleaning up after a children's picnic when he brushed his ankle against a bin bag .
The cut so small it was barely visible, causing necrotizing faciitis - a flesh-eating bug .
Doctors were preparing to amputate his right leg but the antibiotics had started to show signs of working .
By the next evening, his temperature had rocketed to 42Â°C and he could put weight on his ankle .
