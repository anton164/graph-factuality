Manchester City will resist any attempt by Valencia to pull out of a Â£24million deal for Alvaro Negredo to fund a move for Radamel Falcao .
Negredo joined Valencia on loan last summer and the deal included a compulsory purchase clause that triggered a permanent move to the Mestalla as soon as he played for the La Liga club .
Reports in Spain suggested Valencia were having second thoughts about keeping Negredo next season .
