Researchers at the American Museum of Natural History in New York have found 99 footprints left by a barefoot early human in Ileret, northwest Kenya .
They believe they belong to groups who all passed over the soft mud at the same time - perhaps stalking some of the other animals whose prints are also preserved in the mud .
Researchers hope to test their findings by studying the movement patterns of modern day hunters in Africa .
