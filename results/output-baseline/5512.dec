Obese people appear to be protected against dementia, say researchers .
They found people who were underweight in middle age were 34% more likely to be diagnosed with dementia, with a risk around 30% lower than those of a healthy weight .
The findings contradict many previous studies suggesting being fat â€“ with a high Body Mass Index (BMI) - could raise the risk of dementia .
