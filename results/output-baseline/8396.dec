Bruce Davis, 72, was sentenced to life in prison in 1972 for the 1969 slayings of musician Gary Hinman and stuntman Donald 'Shorty' Shea .
Davis, who once bragged of cutting Shea's head off, held Hinman at gunpoint while Charles Manson sliced his face open with a sword .
The parole board cited his age and good behavior as reasons for granting him parole in August last year .
