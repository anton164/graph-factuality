Veteran broadcaster Peter Alliss said legislation designed to stop golf clubs from discriminating against female members has prompted decline in women's membership .
Some clubs had previously only allowed female members if they played at restricted times .
But Equality Act 2010 ruled this was illegal discrimination, which means women must now have equal access to the course â€“ and pay same membership rates as men .
