A new metro line extension opened this week in the Czech capital .
But the point where passengers transfer from trains to buses doesn't have a moving staircase .
Porters are left to carry luggage up and down the stairs at Nadrazi Veleslavin station, in north-west Prague, free of charge .
The project didn't budget for an escalator between the station and bus terminal .
