In 1992, a Drug Enforcement Agency program monitored every telephone call made from the United States to one of the up to 116 countries on their watch list for drug trafficking .
The program also allowed agents to monitor calls that ruled out the possibility of foreign ties to the 1995 bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building .
This is now the oldest known example of the U.S. government authorizing this level of tracking on unknowing citizens of the country .
