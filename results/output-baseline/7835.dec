Scott Kelley, now 50, and Mary Nunes, 19, fled New Hampshire in 2004 .
They fled after Mark Nunes, a physician, was granted custody of his daughter Mary, then eight, to take her for treatment for an unspecified illness .
Genevieve, now 19, was taken to Colorado, where she was not seen for a decade until this week .
The Kelleys fled after Genevieve refused to hand over her daughter to Mr Nunes .
Kelley is now facing a charge of custodial interference, the same charge his wife is due in court next month .
