Charles Severance, 54, has been charged with the murders of Nancy Dunning, Ron Kirby and Ruthanne Lodato, in Alexandria, Virginia, in 2003 .
All three victims were gunned down at their homes in the affluent Washington D.C. suburb of Alexandria .
Severance was arrested in March 2014 over the murders after he sought asylum at the Russian Embassy .
The trial will be moved from Alexandria to Fairfax County because the possibility of an impartial jury is unlikely .
