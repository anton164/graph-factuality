The kite, dubbed 'centipede with a dragon's head', was set to fly at the Wulong International Kite Festival in Chongqing last Saturday .
But Chinese aviation authorities ruled that the kite could not fly and the team were forced to fly only half of it .
They had to fly half of the 6,000-metre-long kite to the sky .
