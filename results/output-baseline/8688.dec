The two-storey hospital in Zhengzhou, central China, was built in the 1960s and belongs to Zheng Gong Hospital in Henan Province .
Hospital bosses employed engineers to put 'wheels' on the building to prevent it being demolished to make way for a new road .
Engineers aim to 'push' the building south by 17.5 metres to its new, safe spot away from demolition zone .
