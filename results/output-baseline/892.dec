Comedian Rik Mayall died suddenly last June aged 56 .
But probate records reveal he suffered serious head injuries and nearly died in a quad-bike accident in 1998 .
His estate could be liable for tax of tens of thousands of pounds which would not have been paid if he had left everything to his wife .
