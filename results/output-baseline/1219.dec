Crystal O'Connor expressed support for a new Indiana religious objections law .
She and her father Kevin O'Connors were forced to close their pizza shop because the phones kept ringing and they didn't know if they were getting real orders or fake ones .
The pizza shop has never catered a gay wedding before .
A new Indiana law bans state or local government from 'substantially 'burdening' a person's beliefs .
