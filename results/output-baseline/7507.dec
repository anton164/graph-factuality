Several DEA agents were taking part in alleged 'sex parties' in Bogota as early as 2001, according to a report released by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform .
The hearing came on the heels of a separate, March 26 report by the Justice Department's Office of the Inspector General that described similar allegations between 2005 and 2012 .
This comes two weeks after a report found that at least 7 agents admitted sleeping with prostitutes while on overseas assignments .
