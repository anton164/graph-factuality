Robbie Clark spent his savings on living in his home in Brent, north west London .
The 96-year-old was a gunner in Durham during the Second World War .
But the council refused to pay for a live-in carer to stay with him .
Now the council want to move him into a care home because it is cheaper .
Mr Clark is blind, deaf in one ear and dependent on a wheelchair, charity says .
