A Russian YouTuber captured the terrifying moment a stream of soil flowed down a bank next to a main road in the Kemerovo Region of Russia .
The eerie phenomenon is called an 'earthflow' and is a viscous flow of fine-grained materials, such as clay, sand and silt that have been saturated with water .
In the video, snow-covered soil can be seen sliding down the bank at the side of a road and crushing trees in its path .
