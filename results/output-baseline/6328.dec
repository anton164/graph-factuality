Former sports minister Gerry Sutcliffe says new claims do not justify inquiry .
Sutcliffe was deputy leader of Bradford City council at time of the tragedy .
He says the fire at Valley Parade was caused by a spectator dropping a cigarette into the rubbish that accumulated under an old timber stand .
The book 'Fifty-Six - The Story of the Bradford Fire' was published on Thursday .
