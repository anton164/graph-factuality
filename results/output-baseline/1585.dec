Jay Brittain, 63, was worried that the baby owlets at Small Breeds Farm Park Park Park and Owl Centre, Herefordshire, looked so similar at birth that he could end up overfeeding them .
He instructed workers at the farm to varnish the claws of each fluffy owlet using nail polish in their own 'talon salon'
After three days their feeds reduce to three times a day and by two months they need to eat twice a day .
