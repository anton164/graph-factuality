Scientists in The Netherlands were using the Lofar radio telescope in the Netherlands to study lightning and thunderclouds .
They found it could measure changes in lightning caused by cosmic rays .
By measuring this during a thunderstorm, they could determine the strength of the electric field at a certain height in the cloud .
The method could provide a novel way to understand thunderstorms .
