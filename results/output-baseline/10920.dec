Thousands of homemade rockets were aimed at church towers in the Aegean island of Chios by rival parishioners in their traditional 'mock war'
Thousands of brave souls even attend the late-night services inside the churches of Aghios Markos and Panaghia Erithiani .
The tradition dates back to the 19th century, when the island was under Turkish occupation but may have older roots .
