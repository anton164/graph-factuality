The disused Rhondda Tunnel, which runs 1,000 feet beneath the Welsh hills, was closed 50 years ago .
It was closed as part of the Beeching Report, which spelled the end for thousands and stations across the rail network in Britain .
Engineers are due to visit the 3,148m tunnel next week - for the first time since it closed .
Under proposals, it would be one of the longest cycle tunnels in the world, second only to the 4,000m Snoqualmie Tunnel near Seattle in the U.S.
