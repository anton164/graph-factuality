Dave Roberts, 50, is in the running to become the mayor of Middlesbrough .
He followed in his great-great-uncle Daniel McAllister's footsteps by jumping off the Transporter Bridge over the River Tees .
But instead of falling to his death, Mr Roberts survived the jump for a charity .
Mr Roberts said: 'I screamed like a child as I was going down, but thoroughly enjoyed it'
