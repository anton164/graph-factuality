Tristram Hunt, shadow education secretary, was visiting primary school in Derbyshire .
He was filmed asking the year six pupil who he would vote for in next month's election if he could take part .
The 10-year-old said: 'I don't really think my son understands the impact of what he said. I do personally support an Australian points system - if you have something to offer the country when you are coming in that's fair enough'
