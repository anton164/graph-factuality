Heather Mack, 19, brutally murdered her mother Sheila von Wiese-Mack with the help of her boyfriend in August and dumped the half-naked body in a taxi outside the upscale St. Regis Bali resort .
Mack avoided the death penalty last week when a judge sentenced her to 10 years, a relatively light sentence that took into account her need to care for her newborn son .
In contrast, Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran have spent the past decade on death row after they were convicted of trying to smuggle heroin from Bali to Australia in 2005 .
