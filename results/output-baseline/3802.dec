Christopher Stefanoni, 50, says his nine-year-old son was moved into a lower-ranking team because his affordable home threatened the ethnic makeup of the town .
Darien, a town of 21,000 with a median household income of $200,000, is 94 per cent white, with 620 Hispanic residents and fewer than 100 blacks .
The town has previously been investigated by the Justice Department over a policy which gave affordable housing priority to people who already lived in Darien .
