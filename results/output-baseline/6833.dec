Pamela Clothier, 92, was admitted to hospital forcing her to leave her bungalow .
The 92-year-old's family were under the impression she planned to sell the house .
But she returned to find her possessions had been cleared out of her home .
She said the worst thing was losing her dog, Mitzy, who was given to an animal sanctuary .
Age UK offered her an 'insulting' Â£1,000 compensation .
