Antoni van Leeuwenhoek used his body as a guinea pig in an experiment .
He took three lice, nestled them among the hairs of his calf and rolled up a tight stocking so that the insects were bound to his leg .
On the seventh day, he removed the stocking and counted more than 80 eggs but no young lice were found .
