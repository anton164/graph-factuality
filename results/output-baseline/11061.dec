Phillip, his wife Gaby and their two young children were left in an unsafe building with no roof and just tarpaulin protecting the house from the winter elements .
The couple had used all their savings to buy the property five years before for £325,000 of their money .
But when they ran out of money, they called in a cowboy builder who recommended they re-tile the roof at a cost of about £3,000 .
It will cost £35,000 to repair the property, which will cost around £35k .
