Luke Lazarus was jailed for at least three years on March 27 for raping an 18-year-old at his father's SOHO nightclub in Kings Cross, inner Sydney in May 2013 .
The victim said she would never be the same following the brutal attack .
Lazarus hired Back Schwartz Vaughan - a liquor licensing specialist - who lodged the appeal five days after the conviction .
He said he thought the sex was consensual and that it wasn't premeditated .
This comes as Eastern Sydney's Waverley mayor Sally Betts wrote a glowing reference to Lazarus 'out of loyalty to the family'
