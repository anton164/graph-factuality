The first black woman to become the top U.S. law enforcement official, Loretta Lynch, was approved by a 56-43 vote .
Curiously absent from the final vote was Texas Senator Ted Cruz - a key opponent of Lynch's nomination .
The White House said it did not know when exactly Lynch would be sworn in but it wasn't likely to be today .
