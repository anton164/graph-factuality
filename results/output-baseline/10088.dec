New Yorker Amanda Chatel is pushing for 'yes means yes' laws to be passed in states across the country .
The law defines consent as 'affirmative, conscious, and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity' from each partner .
Amanda blamed herself for years after her sexual assault because she was 'too young and naive to realize that because I never actually said, I was a bit inebriated'
