The Pillars of Creation are one of the most iconic images ever to be captured by the Hubble Space Telescope .
New observations reveal the pillars only have three million years left before they fade away - a relatively short time in cosmic terms .
They shed light on two gestating stars in the left and middle pillars as well as a jet from a young star that escaped attention up to now .
