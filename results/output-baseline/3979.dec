The patent was filed by the Californian tech giant in March 2011 and awarded earlier this week this week .
It details a system of scanning a user's face using the front-facing camera when the handset is moved into a certain position .
If the scanned face matches a previously taken photo, the phone unlocks automatically .
This relies on the user pressing the power button to enable the screen to unlock .
Android Lollipop users already have an almost identical feature known as 'Trusted Face'
