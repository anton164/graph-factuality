Stunt performer, Antti Pendikainen, was driving his snowmobile off the edge of a mountain in Riksgr√§nsen, Sweden .
The group managed to strap materials together to make an incredible but rickety flying machine .
Using a Go Pro camera attached to Antti's head, the group used wood from an old truck bed, a tandem parachute and duct tape .
