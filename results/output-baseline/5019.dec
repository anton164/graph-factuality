Aaron Hernandez, 25, has pleaded not guilty to murder and firearms charges in the death of Odin Lloyd, a semiprofessional football player who was dating his fianc√©e's sister .
His defense argued that he saw his PCP-taking friends kill Lloyd but did not commit the murder himself .
The former tight end and two friends, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, drove him to an industrial park near Hernandez's home in North Attleboro, Massachusetts, where they shot him to death .
