Earth is constantly vibrating and creating weak microseismic waves, which combine with long waves dragging across the ocean's floor to create the constant hum .
These waves only take 13 seconds or less to complete a single oscillation .
In the mid-1980s, a team of Japanese and Californian seismologists studied the movement of ocean waves at the bottom of the seabed .
