All children must sign a 'home-school agreement' before they start at Turnham Primary School in South-East London .
They must also sign a signature to confirm that they understand their 'responsibilities' while attending the school .
The contract was sent to parents last week along with letters offering a place at the school for children with different sexual orientations and lifestyles .
But the chairman of governors said they knew nothing about the change to the contract .
