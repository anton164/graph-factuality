Brendan Rodgers was fined at Blackburn Magistrates' Court for leaving a £69,950 terrace house in Accrington, Lancashire, with broken windows and rubbish strewn across the garden .
Rodgers and co-owner Judith O'Hagan had been ordered to fix the windows, doors and roof, and to remove the rubbish .
But the pair had their case overturned because he did not receive a summons .
The house is undergoing a £13million regeneration project to sort out over 200 derelict empty properties .
