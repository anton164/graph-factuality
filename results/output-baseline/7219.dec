'Bone flute' found in Slovenia is a bone chewed by hyenas and left in a cave .
It was heralded as the world’s oldest musical instrument .
But now a new analysis has found it is not an instrument - it is a tooth chewed bone .
This suggests it was made into symbolic jewellery for Neanderthals .
Researchers from the Paleo-Logic Independent Institute of Geosciences, Kansas, say all such ‘instruments’ are simply chew toys .
