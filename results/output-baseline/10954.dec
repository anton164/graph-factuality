The Carlton Tavern was the only building in its road not destroyed by bombs .
Landlady Patsy Lord was told by the owners on Easter Monday to close for an 'inventory' but returned two days later to find the pub was no longer standing .
The pub, in Maida Vale, west London, was built in 1921 but was denied planning permission to turn it into flats by Westminster City Council in January .
