Christopher Flowers, 84, was driving down Chili Avenue in Rochester on March 9 .
He dropped a lit cigarette into his shirt, causing several layers of clothing to burst into flames .
Three Good Samaritans pulled over and tried to extinguish the blaze .
But the windy conditions at the time seemed to fanned the flames so much that they engulfed his entire torso and torso .
On Sunday, Flowers, of Chili, was rushed to Strong Memorial Hospital .
