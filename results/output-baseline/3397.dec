Boris Majnaric, 75, of South Jordan, built the 384-sq-ft, four-room bird house in 1996 and went on to rear more than 200 birds - five times over the legal limit .
Majnaric was so fond of his flock he once delivered CPR to an ailing member of the flock .
He spent more than $40,000 fighting the city in court in March, but in late March, a district judge did not sign an order to stop the demolition .
