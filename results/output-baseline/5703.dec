The Andaz Liverpool Street hotel is built on the site of England's first hospital for the mentally ill - the Bethlehem Royal Hospital .
It was often pronounced as 'bedlam' by the likes of Beyonce, Lil Kim and Lady Gaga .
But the hotel is now a swanky boutique hotel with 267 rooms - four of which have been decorated by trendy artists .
