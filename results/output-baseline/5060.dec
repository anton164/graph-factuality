The 90-second clip was filmed by a witness in an indoor area restricted to workers at King Khalid International Airport in Riyadh .
It shows two male employees hurling large suitcases onto the belt and against a wall as they unload a truck .
The men throw the bags with such force that they land with a heavy thud or hit a green barrier .
