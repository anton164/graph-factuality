A 42-year-old man deliberately drove his car straight through the front doors of a night security patrol car before recklessly driving his dark blue Ford Falcon .
Fortunately the station was vacant at the time of the incident before the culprit managed to escape in the smashed-up car but wouldn't have got far without working headlights .
