Researchers observed randomly selected parents with children aged 18 months to five years old at playgrounds in New York .
Children whose carers were distracted were ‘significantly’ more likely to behave in this way .
Researchers measured factors such as the adult’s level of engagement with the child and how often the child jumped off swings or went down a slide head-first .
Three children fell while the researchers were observing them although none was seriously hurt .
