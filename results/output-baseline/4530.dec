Scientists in California have described how to create artificial auroras on Earth .
They said a particle accelerator could be sent 185 miles (300km) up into space .
It would then fire high-energy beams back at Earth's atmosphere .
The beam would last just 0.1 microseconds before firing back towards Earth .
