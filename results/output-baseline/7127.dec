Sarabi, Sarabi, was dropped by musher Laura Allaway's team during the Iditarod race .
The three-year-old dog was spotted on April 15 near Glenn Highway and then again last Friday near Reverend Tim Carrick's United Protestant Church .
Carrick set up a cage trap in the woods between the church and his home and used four bowls of dog kibbles, a pot of chicken stock, liverwurst and a motion activated camera to capture Sarabi .
