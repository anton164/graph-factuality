Scientists funded by Cancer Research UK studied samples taken from tumours in the prostate and around the body in ten affected men .
They found that most of the cells in a tumour stay where they are .
but a small number have the ability to travel through the body, creating new tumours as they go .
The latest study gets to the root of this spread, and could mean better treatment for 42,000 men a year diagnosed with the disease .
