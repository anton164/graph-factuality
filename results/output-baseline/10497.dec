Deborah Kane, 46, from Tyldesley, Manchester, had her right eye removed three years ago in a life-saving nine-hour operation to stop the cancer spreading to her brain .
The mother-of-two believes her cancer developed from getting badly burned on holiday in Lanzarote when she was 15 - where she also bought cheap sunglasses without proper UV protection .
Debbie has raised over Â£10,000 for the Royal Manchester Eye Hospital where she was treated .
