Gemma Flanagan, 31, was left paralysed after suddenly being hit by Guillain Barre Syndrome, a rare condition which attacks the nervous system .
She assumed partying in heels during a stopover in Las Vegas was cause of her pain .
But for seven months her family watched as she was left frozen in her own body .
Now she is making her catwalk debut today in London's Olympia Neuro Rehabilitation Unit .
