The 40-second clip was recorded by Haim Kaplan at the Ngorongoro Conservation Area in Tanzania .
It shows the driver of a supply truck standing next to his vehicle as a group of baboons approach .
The man is forced to retreat as one makes a lunge at him and another jumps into the back of the truck .
