Sarah Jewell, 25, was expecting a tax refund when she received a letter from the IRS informing her that someone had filed her Social Security number as deceased in November 2014 .
The IRS said about 9,000 living Americans are misreported as deceased to the administration, making up 0.35 per cent of three million annual deaths .
Jewell's number has yet to be reinstated and her job as a licensed pharmacy technician could be in jeopardy if the problem isn't fixed .
