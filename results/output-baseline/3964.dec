Gareth Shoulder, 24, has been recruited by the BBC to comment on the Election as a member of its ‘Generation 2015 Election youth panel’
The self-styled ‘angry Leftie revolutionary and magician’ mocked David Cameron and Ivan, who died aged six in 2009 after being born with cerebral palsy and epilepsy .
The BBC says it ‘hand-picked’ its 200-strong youth panel to ‘address fundamental questions about the relationship between UK young adults and democracy’
