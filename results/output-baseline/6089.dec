Kevin Franklin, 53, put the lights up on his council house last November .
He didn't take them down in January because he wanted to switch them on again .
But the continued presence of the lights has angered some neighbours .
Mr Franklin said: 'I am fed up of seeing your grotesque tacky council house Christmas lights. It sticks out like a sore thumb'
