Dr Arye Shimron says he has linked the James Ossuary to the long disputed 'Jesus Family tomb' in the city's East Talpiot neighbourhood .
He says the 'son of God' was buried with nine other people, including 'Judah, son of Jesus' and his wife, named Mary .
Research could have enormous ramifications as it suggests that Jesus was married, fathered a child and that a physical resurrection did not take place .
