Rick Yoes, 57, from Grand Prairie, Texas, spent the weekend in jail to avoid paying $1,700 in fines related to nearly two decades of code violations .
Yoes, an electrician at Tarrant County College, was shocked when he received a postcard a couple weeks ago saying he had six outstanding code violations and that there was a warrant out for his arrest .
He turned himself in this weekend and spent two nights in jail before a friend paid his fine to secure his release .
