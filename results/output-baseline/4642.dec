Julie Schenecker, 54, was convicted last May of shooting her 13-year-old son Beau, 13, and daughter Calyx, 16, in their Tampa Bay, Florida, home in January 2011 .
She said she shot the children because they were 'mouthy' and that Calyx told her she was suffering from mental illness .
But police disputed the claims, saying she had admitted to killing the children for being 'inexcusable'
