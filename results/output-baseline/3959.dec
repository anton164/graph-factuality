The Modular Robotic Vehicle, or MRV, was developed at NASA's Johnson Space Center .
It is driven remotely by four independent wheel modules called e-corners .
They are controlled remotely at up to 70mph and can spin on the spot .
This allows the driver to park sideways to slip directly in between two cars .
