Jasper and Jasmine were surrendered to Pug Rescue and Adoption Victoria in 2013 with a variety of health problems .
Both dogs were morbidly obese, struggling to breathe, and almost blind due to pigmentary keratitis, where a thick brown pigment covered their corneas .
The couple decided to 'wed' their new pups in an effort to raise money for the organisation that saved them .
