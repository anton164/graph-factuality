Researchers at the Natural History Museum in London and University College London have found evidence that the human bones had the flesh cut from them .
They found tooth marks on many of the bones, which were found in the cave in Gough's Cave in Somerset .
Archaeologists say the findings suggest people in the late Ice Age indulged in ritual cannibalism, perhaps as a macabre way to revere their dead kin .
