The Secret Service took more than a year to replace a broken alarm at the former president's Houston home .
The alarm failed at his Houston residence in September 2013 .
It took until December 2014 for the alarm to be replaced because it had exceeded its life cycle .
Bush tweeted that he and his wife have 'great respect' for the Secret Service .
