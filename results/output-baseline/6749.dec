Hannah Overton, 37, has already spent seven years in prison for the murder of her adopted son, Andrew Burd, in 2006 .
Overton's conviction was overturned because of ineffective counsel, meaning this would not be a case of double jeopardy .
Her family stood by her and protested her innocence, but prosecutors have now dropped all charges against her and will no longer be looking into her case .
