Sydney psychologist Darryl Dewar hugged his client, patted her head and used offensive language during a consultation in October 2012 .
The woman, who was having suicidal thoughts at the time, said he asked her to sing for him and asked her if her mother was a 'f---ing bitch' with 'lots of kids, multiple fathers'
A tribunal found Mr Dewar guilty and banned him from re-registering as a psychologist unless he took part in further education .
