Mary Day, 60, of Dorset, claimed £16,500 of income support and disability allowance despite having £27,000 of her own savings in the bank .
She went on three trips to Goa in 2009, 2011 and 2014 but failed to tell the authorities .
Tax watchdog The Taxpayers' Alliance said Day's sentence would do little to discourage others from committing benefit fraud .
