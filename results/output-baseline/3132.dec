Researchers from Nagoya University and the University of Tokyo in Japan studied stone tools used by people in the Early Ahmarian culture and the Protoaurignacian culture .
They found the human tools were no better than Neanderthal-created tools of the same era .
Instead, they used small stone points as tips for hunting weapons like throwing spears .
This suggests we may need to rethink the reasons humans survived Neanderthals .
