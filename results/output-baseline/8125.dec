Robert Durst entered his plea during an arraignment in a New Orleans court on weapons charges that accused him of possessing a firearm after a felony conviction and possessing both a firearm and an illegal drug, marijuana .
Durst's hands were shackled to his sides, and two defense attorneys lifted him from an armchair to walk to the podium .
He was arrested in New Orleans last month on the eve of the finale of a six-part HBO documentary called 'The Jinx' about Durst's disappearance .
