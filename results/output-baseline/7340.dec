Australian movie and music downloaders could soon be slapped with a 10 per cent tax on movies and music downloaded from streaming services such as Netflix and Apple .
The changes may also affect consumers buying any products for less than $1,000 online from overseas, thus affecting companies such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon and eBay .
Consumer advocacy group Choice says tech-savvy Australians might be able to avoid the tax by concealing their location through virtual private networks .
