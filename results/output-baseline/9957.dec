Sainsbury's app is in development and will be trialled at a store in Wandsworth later this year .
It lets homeowners gradually build up a list of items they need over the course of a week or fortnight, for example .
As customers scan their household items, a live pricing tool will show their list with current store prices .
These prices will update automatically if an item goes on sale or becomes part of a multi-buy deal .
