The sprawling house, built on the site of an old telephone exchange in Chelsea, has been sold for 300 times the average price of home in England and Wales .
It is 18 times the size of the average new home, with nine bedrooms, nine bathrooms, a cinema, a Japanese water garden and an indoor swimming pool .
The stamp duty alone, paid on top of the price, is enough for the Treasury to pay the annual salary of 330 nurses .
