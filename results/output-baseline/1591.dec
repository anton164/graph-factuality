Ryan Heritage from Wiltshire posted a message on Trowbridge police's Facebook page .
He went out for a night out in his home town where he was spotted by police who chased him on foot before finally grabbing him .
The 18-year-old was thrown in the cells for the night and put before magistrates the following morning .
Police later re-posted his original message and added their own: 'His luck ran out #arrested'
