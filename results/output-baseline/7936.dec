Researchers have found a pattern in two apparently unrelated places - skin cells and the mysterious fairy circles in the Namibian desert .
They compared the number of 'neighbours' adjacent to fairy circles to skin cells in the desert like zebras rolling in circles .
The majority of skin cells were found in the very large and very small scales of earth .
Researchers believe they have identified a small, but vital piece of the puzzle .
