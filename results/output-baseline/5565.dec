Stephen Hogger, 55, had been at St Peter and St Paul's for 17 years .
He was sacked after apparently falling out with senior figures .
The church will now be without a choir for the first time in 200 years.
The walkout means it will be the first since the church was founded .
Church organist Mr Hogger said: 'It seems to be down to a clash of personalities'
