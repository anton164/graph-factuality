Chandni Nigam, 19, spent six years battling demons which spawned from obsession to do well at school .
She would stay up late studying, resulting in sleep deprivation and a negative impact on her performance at school - which caused further depression and anxiety .
Coroner Peter Bedford told the inquest that Miss Nigam had often refused treatment .
He said he felt he was 'torturing' his daughter by making her attend appointments - and eventually accepted that she would one day take her own life .
