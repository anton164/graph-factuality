Lawyers have warned that the differences in defamation law in Northern Ireland mean HBO's 'Going Clear' might not be broadcast by Sky Atlantic .
It was due to premiere in the UK earlier this month to coincide with its American release .
But Northern Ireland is not subject to the 2013 Defamation Act because Sky is unable to differentiate its signal between regions for technical reasons .
