SeaWorld has released an almost five-year-old video that shows John Hargrove using the N-word seven times while talking on the phone with a female friend .
In the five-minute video, he discusses an incident in which five black men allegedly threw a rock at the woman on the other line that she said hit the back of her head .
The company has been given the video by an 'internal whistle-blower' last weekend and that his employment would have been terminated 'immediately' if they had known 'he engaged in this kind of behavior'
