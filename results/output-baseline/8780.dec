Vietland-based VÃ­t Jedlicka, 31, is the self-declared president of 'Liberland'
He claims to have created a 'micronation' of land along the Croatian-Serbia border .
He says the idea came from a desire to live in a country where 'honest' people could prosper .
If Liberland is ever recognised it will become the third smallest sovereign state in the world .
