Jonathan Keats, an experimental philosopher and conceptual artist, has designed a 'millennium camera' that he hopes will chronicle climate change .
The camera will be placed on the Stearns Steeple on a college campus in Massachusetts .
Keats hopes the resulting image will highlight climate change by taking a 1,000-year exposure of a western Massachusetts mountain range .
