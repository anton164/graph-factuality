A Utah photographer, Alan Lawrence, created a photo series called 'Wil Can Fly' in which his 18-month-old son, Wil, appears to be flying .
He created the illusion by holding his son up in the photos and cropping himself out .
The father of five has taken the photos in a calendar and plans to donate half the proceeds to two Down Syndrome foundations .
