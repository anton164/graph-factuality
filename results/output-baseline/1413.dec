The state that calls itself the 'Land of Lincoln' has proposed eliminating the state Historic Preservation Agency that manages sites including the tomb of Abraham Lincoln .
The site was pilloried in National Geographic magazine as having 'all the historical character of an office lobby'
Historians say the site was 'a disappointment' and reconstructed in 'incongruous Art Deco style'
'It's strange to think that there is a place where Lincoln still physically exists in the world,' said historian Adam Goodheart .
