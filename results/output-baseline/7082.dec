Major General Allen Batschelet says that 10 percent of young Americans will be so grossly overweight by the end of the decade that the military will be unable to recruit enough qualified soldiers .
The maximum body fat percentage that the Army allows for recruits is 20 percent for men and 30 percent for women .
Army recruiters will spend time educating the hopefuls on diet and exercise and encourage them to lose the pounds necessary to qualify for boot camp .
