Natalie Fletcher's '100 Bodies Across America' project sees painted individuals blended into the likes of tourist hotspots, forests and ruins .
Each work takes between 45 minutes and three hours to complete, with her subjects wearing only underwear whilst being painted .
She hopes to complete the series by September this year .
