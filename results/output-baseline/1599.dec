Some amusement parks have been erected in poor areas on the outskirts of Islamabad and Rawalpindi .
Many of those who are enjoying the rides have fled their homes due to fighting between security forces and militants in the tribal area of Bajur .
The amusement parks offer the chance to play and laugh with others and escape their difficult lives, if only for a few hours .
