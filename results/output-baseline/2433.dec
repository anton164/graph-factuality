The Nigerian-flagged Thunder had been fishing off the west coast of Africa for 110 days off the coast of Sao Tope .
It was being tracked by activists from the charity Sea Shepherd who believed it was engaged in illegal fishing .
The crew of 40 all escaped into life rafts before the ship sank to the ocean bottom .
