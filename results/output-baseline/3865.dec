Researchers at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California cut real skin samples and then attempted to rip them apart .
Using X-ray beams they found that the curly fibers of collagen that make up the skin straighten and stretch in response to a tear to share the load .
The researchers hope their findings could lead to stronger new materials that do not easily tear .
