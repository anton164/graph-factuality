The Church of England’s ambitious plans involve harnessing the energy of Bath's 45°C spring water to power a modern heating system .
Archaeologists plan to excavate ancient crypts below the church to tap into a Roman drain where 850,000 litres of natural spring water empties every day into the ground .
They hope to divert the warm water through a network of underground pipes to provide a world-first natural underfloor heating system for the abbey .
