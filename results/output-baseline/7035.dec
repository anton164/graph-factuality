Locals from the island of Kudahuvadhoo reported seeing 'a low-flying jumbo jet' on the morning of March 8 last year .
The reports come as acoustic scientists refuse to rule out the possibility that 'distinctive' data they recorded from the area may have come from the impact of the aircraft as it hit the Indian Ocean .
