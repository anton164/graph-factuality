Linda McLean was in her classroom at Pine Eagle Charter School in Halfway, Oregon when a masked man burst in with a gun and lowered it to her head and pulled the trigger .
The teacher had no idea it was a drill to test her 'preparedness' or that the gun was loaded with blanks .
McLean was left with post-traumatic stress disorder and had to leave the school as a form of desensitization .
