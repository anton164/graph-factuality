Michael Brelo, 31, is charged with voluntary manslaughter for the deaths of Timothy Russell, 43, and Malissa Williams, 30, in November 2012 .
Brelo stood on the hood of a beat-up Chevy Malibu to fire 15 rounds into the windshield of the suspects' car .
He is the lone officer charged because prosecutors say he waited until after the initial salvo had ended to fire the last of the 49 rounds .
A judge will decide whether Brelos is guilty or innocent .
