Alondra Luna Nunez, 14, was taken to Mexico last week by federal agents who were working for Interpol on the orders of a Texas judge .
She was reunited with her real family after a DNA test proved she was not the daughter of Houston resident Dorotea Garcia .
Garcia convinced authorities that Alondra was her long-lost daughter and claimed she had a scar above her eyebrow .
