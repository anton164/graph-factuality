New Broadcasting House in Central London covers half a million square feet .
The building has specially designed 'huddle zones' and a 'meeting tower' on stilts in the atrium .
But the Corporation has admitted it 'occasionally' runs out of meeting rooms .
It has spent Â£47,198 on booking external spaces nearby during the last financial year .
