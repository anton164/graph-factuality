A state investigation was launched following complaints from two large agencies that huge amounts of water are mysteriously disappearing from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta .
Delta farmers don't deny using as much water as they need, but they say they're not stealing it because their history of living at the water's edge gives them that right to use it .
At issue is California's century-old water rights system that has been based on self-reporting and little oversight .
