Chiropractor Gertrude Pitkanen sold babies to adoptive parents for as little as $100 in Butte, Montana, in the 1950s .
They were driven from their mothers' arms seconds after they were born and handed over to their adoptive parents .
Most of the children have now aged, have families and forged their own lives .
