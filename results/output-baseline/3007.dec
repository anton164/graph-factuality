News broke this weekend that NBC anchor Brian Williams lied to the press about being on a US military chopper hit by an RPG-propelled grenade .
He was suspended with no pay for six months after it emerged that he lied in his reporting to make himself look good at least 11 times .
Williams has up to a $50million contract and POLITICO claims that he could receive up to $30million if he leaves the network .
