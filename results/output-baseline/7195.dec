Dr Adrian Quarterman, of Dundee University, is working on a laser which will convert sun beams into energy .
The lasers will orbit the earth, covered in mirrors to help it harvest the sun's sunlight and convert it into laser light .
If it works, it could mean solar power could become viable in Scotland .
But Dr Quarterman is now hoping to move trials to Portugal .
