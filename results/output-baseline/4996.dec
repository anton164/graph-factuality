Fox News Sunday anchor Chris Wallace was asked: 'Have you seen Kelly Clarkson? Holy cow, did she blow up?'
The 67-year-old said the singer 'could stay off the deep dish pizza for a while'
On Friday, Wallace's fellow Fox News anchor Greta Van Susteren took to Twitter to criticise Wallace for his 'disgusting' comments .
