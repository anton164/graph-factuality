Labour leader said he will 'abolish' the 200-year-old rule for non-domicile status .
He said they make Britain an 'offshore tax haven for a few' and can 'no longer be justified'
But Mr Miliband said non-doms can only pay UK tax on UK income, not earnings from overseas .
The Labour leader said: 'Why should there be one rule for some and another for everybody else?'
