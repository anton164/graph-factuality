All Saints Church in Wolverhampton re-scheduled the service today .
It is the only place where prostitutes can receive support offered by the sessions .
The decision comes after prostitutes were left disappointed when drop-in sessions were cancelled on Christmas Day and New Year's Day because they both fell on a Thursday .
