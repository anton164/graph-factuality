Adele Berry, of Reddish, Greater Manchester, was bombarded with texts .
She was put through to a call centre in South Africa over a problem with her bill .
But she was left stunned when the man later got in touch with her .
He asked her if 'his in laws' were, but did nothing to suggest she was interested .
The man has been suspended by Vodafone, which has a number of call centres in the UK .
