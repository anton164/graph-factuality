Jordan Waddingham scoured bushland at Karoola, north east of Launceston in Tasmania to unravel the plague of wasps .
Within minutes, the little wasp hunter made a startling discovery when he stumbled across the gigantic two-year-old nest .
It took two days to unearth the nest from the ground and four men to carry it out of the bush .
The nest is measured at one metre tall and a circumference of three metres .
