Revellers in Jharkhand state tie themselves upside down onto a pole that hand hangs just feet above a raging fire in the hope it will bring them good luck .
The annual fire festival lasts 11 days and sees dozens of participants dangle over the flames while a Hindu priest uses oil to stoke the inferno .
Locals believe the practice helps protect the village from drought and disease .
