A swastika and the word 'scum' were sprayed on the windows of the offices in Aberdeen last night .
A 'Q' was also added to the blue front door, which some people said stood for quisling - a person who collaborates with an enemy .
It comes six months after buildings and polling stations were defaced in the run up to the Scottish Referendum .
