It has been part of a 100-day trial at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich .
The clock was initially set ticking a year ago after being strapped to a supporting pillar .
But wax seals were placed on its case so its accuracy could be verified .
Clock has since been certified by the Guinness World Records .
