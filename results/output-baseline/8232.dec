Sen. Bob Corker, a Republican from Tennessee, said on Sunday that congressional oversight 'doesn't mean there won't be a deal'
Corker said that Congress has a responsibility to scour the details of a final plan - including any classified annexes - and ask the Obama administration hard questions about it .
The deal requires the president to transmit, within five days, the text of the full agreement, along with materials related to its implementation .
