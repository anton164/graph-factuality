The video was captured on a camera phone at a high school in Portland, Oregon .
It shows a well-built man lecturing a class of students about the effect the axe will have on the cinder block .
The teacher then hoists the axe up over his head and swings it straight down on to the student's groin .
Luckily the teacher, Haneef Mubarak, says nobody was fired - and remarkably the teacher who was hit turned out to be the teacher .
