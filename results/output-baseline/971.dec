Anthony Ray Hinton, 58, was released from the Jefferson County Jail in Birmingham on Friday after 30 years on death row .
He was released after prosecutors admitted they couldn't find evidence that a gun at his home fired the bullets used in the 1985 murders .
Hinton says he should not have waited 30 years for investigators to test the gun that was seized from his home and determine he could not be linked to the crime .
His sister, Darlene Gardner, said: 'Everybody that played a part in sending him to death, you will answer to God'
