Wat Pha Luang Ta Bua in Thailand's western Kanchanaburi province - commonly known as 'The Tiger Temple' - has long proved a hit among tourists .
Thai wildlife officials began a headcount on Friday after a vet complained to police that three tigers had recently disappeared from the sanctuary .
Officials say the temple has been keeping the animals without the proper paperwork and vowed to seize them .
