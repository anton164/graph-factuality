The 1954 Bentley R-Type Continental Fastback sold for £739,212 - a record for the auction house .
It was commissioned by Welsh racing driver R Weatherall and painted in his racing colour of purple - the license plate still bears his initials .
But when it is ready, it could be worth more than £1million - and would prove itself a wise investment .
