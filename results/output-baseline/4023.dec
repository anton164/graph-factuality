Denise Huskins, 29, was allegedly snatched from her home by kidnappers who tied her boyfriend up on March 23, then released 400 miles away beside her parents' home .
Huskins, who was with her boyfriend at the time, says he will turn himself in, but only if his co-conspirators are given immunity .
Last week, the group demanded an apology from the Vallejo Police Department for calling the incident a 'training mission to test means and methods that would be used on higher net worth targets'
