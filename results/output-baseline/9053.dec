Irwin Horwitz, a Texas A&M professor, emailed his strategic management class of about 30 students telling them he was going to fail all of them because of the bad behavior he had witnessed during the semester .
In the email, Horwitz claimed that he had seen cheating, heard false rumors about himself and had been called a 'f****** moron' to his face .
The university has said that the failing grades Horwitz's wishes to give out will not hold them back .
