Jia Binhui, 25, cannot afford hospital treatment and hopes his alternative treatment will cure his leukaemia cells .
He built a human barbecue in his garden in Yunlong County in southwest China's Yunnan Province .
It is made from sawdust, twigs and branches which he lies on like a spit roast .
Jia has had a bone marrow transplant costing Â£55,000 which was funded by well-wishers .
