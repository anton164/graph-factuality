Anthony Stokes, 17, died on Tuesday after he crashed a stolen Honda into a pole as he fled from police in Roswell, Georgia .
He was initially refused a life-saving heart transplant at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta two years ago .
The hospital initially refused to put him on the waiting list for a new organ because they thought he would be 'non-compliant' with the treatment .
Stokes, from Decatur, Georgia, suffered from a dilated cardiomyopathy so his heart was unable to pump enough blood .
His death comes less than two years after he was given a second chance
