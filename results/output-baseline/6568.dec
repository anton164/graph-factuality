Bank refused to grant £250,000 mortgage because husband would have been over 65 when 18-year-deal finished .
Husband did not plan to retire at 65 and his final salary pension would be large enough to cover monthly repayments .
Bank was ordered to pay £500 to the couple for their ‘distress and inconvenience’ over the ‘unfair application of its age policy’
