Gold Coast City Council will finally be able to shut down illegal party houses in suburban areas after the state government approved new planning powers .
There are more than 700 party houses across the city, which are often used for unruly weekend-long parties that distress and terrify neighbours due to noise, nudity, lewd behaviour and violence .
The new powers, approved by Deputy Premier Jackie Trad, mean there is now an official definition of a party house so the council can enforce laws to shut them down .
