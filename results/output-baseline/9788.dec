Demetri Nelson still had his victim's keys in his pocket when he was arrested Tuesday, the Sumter County sheriff's office said .
Deputies said Nelson broke into a woman's home and demanded money from her to drive to a Manning Avenue home .
When they got there, Nelson told the woman to get into the trunk of the car, WFSB reported .
Nelson was unable to drive the car because of the manual transmission, however, and the woman used the emergency trunk latch to escape .
