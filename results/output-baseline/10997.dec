Flight Lieutenant Stephen Beaumont was one of just seven of the 24 pilots in his squadron who survived the 1940 Second World War battle .
He carried the bear in his cockpit and printed the Royal crest, the letters AM for Air Ministry and his nickname 'Beaumont Bear' on his chest .
When he died in 1997, his bear was passed to his family on behalf of a private collector .
It is now being tipped to sell for an estimated Â£10,000 when it goes under the hammer .
