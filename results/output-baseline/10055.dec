The extra stretch of coastline on Shiretoko Peninsula near the town of Rausu has risen as high as 50ft from the sea surface .
Geologists believe the phenomenon is a result of a landslide nearby, when melting ice and snow caused a section of land to drop, pivoting the underwater area into the air .
It is not believed to be related to the 7.8magnitude earthquake that hit Kathmandu Valley on Saturday .
