Researchers subjected two commercial Li-ion batteries to heat .
They found copper inside melted, indicating temperatures of at least 1,085°C (1,985°F)
This is when the rate of heat generated in a second cell caused the entire cap to detach .
During tests, one cell remained intact during battery failure .
