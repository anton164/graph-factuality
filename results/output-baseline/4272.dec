James Weld stumped up Â£15,000 to end three-year stand-off with Natural England over access to Durdle Door on Dorset's Jurassic coast .
The steps led to a perilous scramble down a crumbling cliff to reach the shore .
Natural England said they were happy the steps had been reopened but declined to comment on Mr Weld's claims .
