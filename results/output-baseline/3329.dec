Avoca Beach in the Central Coast, about 95kms north of Sydney, resembled something from a horror film on Tuesday .
Sylvia Freedman filmed the disturbing scene that stretched for more than 15 metres from the top of the beach pathway to beyond the water's edge .
She said: 'When the wind blew, the foam just felt like you were in a snow globe'
