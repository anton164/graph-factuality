University of Illinois scientists have created the first 3D simulation of merging black holes in a disk known as a quasar .
It shows what happens when two supermassive black holes collide .
The simulation was led by scientists at the University of Illinois and included Dr Roman Gold, Dr Vasileios Paschalidis, Dr Stuart Shapiro, Dr Zachariah Etienne and Dr Harald Pfeiffer .
This means the prediction can be tested in real life in real time .
