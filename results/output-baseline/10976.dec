Some 1,500 migrants rescued by Italian navy and coast guard ships in less than 24 hours, officials said .
Rescues were made as newly released figures show an increase in migrant arrivals into the EU via Italy on the same period last year .
About 170,000 migrants entered the EU through Italy last year by way of the dangerous sea crossing organised by human traffickers, most departing from Libya .
