The tree was planted in January-Wabash Park in Ferguson, Missouri on Saturday as a dedication to Michael Brown Jr Dedicated Tree 04/15 .
It was called 'a symbol of peace, comfort and hope for all who gather around its branches' at a small ceremony led by the Black Caucus of the American Library Association, which donated the tree .
But by Sunday morning, the tree had been stripped down, leaving just a shard of the trunk .
