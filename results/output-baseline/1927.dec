Edward Snowden may have been told not to speak out on Russian surveillance but continued attacking America in order to save himself from jail in the US .
He accused the former US spy of not being 'transparent' and said he was being 'secretive' about his arrangements with the Russian authorities .
The decision by Russian President Vladimir Putin was seen as a snub to US President Barack Obama .
