Scientists are working towards digitally recreating the bees' cognitive abilities of the Apis Mellifera or European Honeybee .
The artificial brain is being created by the Green Brain Project, which is a collaboration between researchers from the Universities of Sheffield and Sussex .
They mapped out the brain of the honeybee and recreated it with circuits that fire on and off in an organic brain .
