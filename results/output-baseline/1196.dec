Ann Malsbury, 22, of Coventry, battered Lee Judson with a saucepan and hair straighteners after she flew into a rage .
But when Mr Judson bent down to pick up something, she jumped on his back and wrapped a white iPod lead around his neck .
She stabbed at him four times - penetrating his clothing but not his skin .
Malsbury was given a community order with 18 months of supervision .
