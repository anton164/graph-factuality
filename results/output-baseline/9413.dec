A federal court of appeals threw out Bonds' obstruction of justice conviction on Wednesday .
Bonds broke Hank Aaron's long-standing career record of 755 homers in 2007, finished that season with 762 .
On April 22, 2015, he was convicted of the obstruction charge in 2011 for his testimony before a grand jury investigating the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative, when he answered a question about injections by saying he was 'a celebrity child'
The larger group, which listened to arguments from prosecutors and Bonds' lawyers last September, concluded there was insufficient evidence his initial evasive answer was material to the government's investigation
