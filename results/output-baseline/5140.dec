US YouTube user Elman511 cracked open an over-sized egg that was laid by one of his hens, exclaiming: ‘The big egg has another normal egg in it!’
In the video, he then cracks the smaller egg, which also has a yolk and white inside .
The unusual occurrence is thought to be caused when a hen is in the process of forming an egg in her oviduct and another oocyte is released too soon .
