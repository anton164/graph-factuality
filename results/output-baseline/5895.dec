Joanne Whitehouse, 44, applied for her daughter Alice to go to St John Fisher's RC Primary School in Middleton near Rochdale .
She was told there would be 'no issue' with her daughter gaining a place .
But when the school allocations were announced today, she found out today .
Ms Whitehouse is planning to appeal the decision and says she can't split herself in half and be at both schools at the same time .
