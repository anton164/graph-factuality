Photographer James Oatway captured the brutal murder of Emmanuel Sithole in Alexandra township, Johannesburg on Saturday .
He was in the neighbourhood to interview a number of foreign-born shopkeepers who had looted in the area .
But in a desperate twist he found it was closed because a foreign doctor had failed to turn up for his shift for fear of being attacked by the xenophobic hordes .
The victim was taken to hospital where he later died, the cause of death established as a direct stab wound to the heart .
