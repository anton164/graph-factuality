The Royal Mint will mark the birth of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's second child in the same way it commemorated the arrival of Prince George in 2013 .
Babies born on the same day as George were entitled to one of 2,015 free 'lucky' silver pennies .
The coin will be presented in a special white box, which will be tied with a purple ribbon and feature the image of a silver carousel horse .
