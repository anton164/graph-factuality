Dennis Sears changed his will to leave everything to live-in home carer Nermin Kancefer months after she moved in to his £615,000 flat .
He disinherited his surviving relatives who had been the intended beneficiaries for 20 years .
His family said the carer exploited the 'vulnerable' childless widower, who had Parkinson's disease and was in poor health .
Mr Sears' family challenged the will but agreed a £50,000 settlement in August .
