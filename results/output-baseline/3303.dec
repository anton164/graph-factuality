Dr Milton Wainwright has been trying to convince academics that he has found 'extra-terrestrial organisms' floating 25 miles (40km) above the planet .
He says the organisms test positive for DNA, and have mass that is six times bigger than the size limit of a particle which can be elevated from Earth to this height .
His research has been widely criticised by the scientific community .
