The Australian Securities and Investments Commission took action against Aldi last year after an investigation revealed it did not disclose a 0.5 percent surcharge placed on transactions made using tap and go contactless payment systems .
Aldi has not consistently disclosed the surcharge to customers and many stores still do not have signs at entrances and signs warning of surcharges .
