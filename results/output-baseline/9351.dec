Byron Schlenker and his daughter Emily, 14, hold the world's widest tongue .
Their buds measure 8.6cm across - the same width as a beer mat and 2cm wider than an iPhone 6 .
Byron only found out he was a world-beater when he picked up a copy of the Guinness Book of World Records while helping daughter Emily with a school project .
