Mick Tabone, 74, first came across the 5.2 metre croc in 1989 .
The croc had apparently been killing cattle in Eubenangee Swamp near Mirriwinni, near Cairns .
Mr Tabone spent the next six months setting up traps for the croc .
Rangers had already been trying to capture the crocodile after a warrant was issued to kill it .
