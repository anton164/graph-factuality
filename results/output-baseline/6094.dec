Cryos International, an online sperm bank, is moving its offices from New York to the Central Florida Research Park in Orlando .
It is located yards away from the University of Central Florida, which has an undergraduate intake of 52,000 students per year .
The company says the decision is due to the 'intense competition for donors' in New York .
Donors can earn up to $750 per month from donating sperm online to all 50 U.S. states and 80 countries .
