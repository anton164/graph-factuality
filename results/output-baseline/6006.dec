Roma's Stadio Olimpico Stadium will be closed for the next home game .
A Serie A disciplinary tribunal said the banners were 'by their content provocatively insulting' the mother of a Napoli fan who was killed in violent clashes last year .
The taunts were aimed at Antonella Leardi whose son Ciro Esposito died after being shot during violent clashes between supporters following last year's Coppa Italia final .
