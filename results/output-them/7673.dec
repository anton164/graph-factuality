Volunteers who have restored one of the Dunkirk ` Little Ships ' are now hoping they will be able to take the vessel back to the beaches where it helped to rescue 600 British soldiers .
Massey Shaw is still capable of pumping out 3,000 gallons of water every minute - as much as four fire engines .
The boat went out of service in 1971 .
