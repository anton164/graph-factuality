 Kim Richards stormed out of an interview with Dr Phil McGraw after a highly emotional discussion of her alcoholism .
The hysterical Real Housewife broke down in tears and went into full meltdown as observers revealed she bolted from the room where Dr Phil had offered to help place her in a top treatment program .
But Richards apparently snubbed Dr Phil 's offer of help as eyewitnesses heard her scream ` F *** ' , and other obscenities when she ran out of the room .
Richards , 50 and charged with public intoxication , trespassing , resisting an officer and battery on a police officer .
