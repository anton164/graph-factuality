 Loretta Reinholdt , 54 , and Andy Wasinger , 46 , were on their second day into a trip from Belize to the Honduran island of Roatan in which they were learning to sail on a 17-meter-long hired boat with a captain when they were attacked .
Four men with guns and knives boarded the sailboat and took all of their money after asking for gas .
They were pushing their boat to the shore of a remote beach , leaving the couple and captain stranded for four days .
