 The orbiting spacecraft captured a shot of Curiosity near the base of Mount Sharp in Gale Crater .
But interestingly , the rover 's tracks are not visible - possibly because they have been swept away by the Martian weather .
The HiRise camera is able to take images of the surface with a resolution of 10 inches -LRB-- per pixel , allowing it to spot the rover on the surface .
Curiosity is the fourth rover to visit Mars .
