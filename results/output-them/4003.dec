Nicole Kidman has been slammed by an union representing 25,000 flight attendants for her new ad campaign with Etihad Airways .
In an open letter to Kidman , the president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants , Laura Glading , wrote the sponsorship deal was at odds with the Australian Oscar winner 's role as a United Nations Women 's Goodwill Ambassador .
Etihad has rejected the allegation , arguing its commitment to its employees is one of the airline 's top priorities .
