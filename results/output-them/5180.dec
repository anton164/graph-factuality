Blackburn Rovers boss Gary Bowyer has challenged star striker Jordan Rhodes to become an FA Cup hero as the Championship underdogs face Liverpool in the first full house at Ewood Park since 2011 .
Rovers rejected a Â£ 12million bid from Hull City for Scotland international Rhodes at the start of the sixth-round replay .
Blackburn were a laughing stock when they were FA Cup quarter-finals in 2013 .
