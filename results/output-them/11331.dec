John Howard , 66 , had been a member of the Overseas Press and Media Association for 30 years but began stealing funds two years ago , leaving the company facing bankruptcy .
The father-of-three had sole access to the non-profit organisation 's account and enjoyed dining alone on several Â£ 300 meals a month and also on flowers .
His fraud was only uncovered after the association had problems paying its creditors and Howard started to dodge emails and phone calls .
