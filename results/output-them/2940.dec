 Jordan Waddingham scoured through bushland at Karoola , north east of Launceston in Tasmania to unravel the plague of wasps after his mother Stephanie offered him $ 20 to locate the nest .
Young Jordan said he followed a trail of wasp when he stumbled across the 90-kilogram nest .
The nest will be on display at the Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery .
