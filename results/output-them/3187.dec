 Yorkshire 's Barney Gibson has retired from the sport .
The Leeds-born wicketkeeper entered the record books in 2011 when he lined up against Durham University just 27 days after his 15th birthday .
But that match proved to be his only appearance at senior level .
The 19-year-old said it was a difficult decision to retire from cricket at such a young age .
