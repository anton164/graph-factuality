London Midland has vowed to give police images of a ` disgusting ' passenger suspected of defecating inside a train carriage as it travelled through the Birmingham area .
The passenger who made the awful discovery said the smell was so bad that it forced the operator to cancel the service from Lichfield Trent Valley to Longbridge .
London Midland said CCTV images of the culprit would be passed onto police for investigation .
