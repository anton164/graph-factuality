The son in law of New York politician Sheldon Silver was indicted Monday on two charges unrelated to the separate investigation into his famous power-broker relative .
Just three months after Silver was arrested on corruption charges , his son-in-law Marcello Trebitsch , 37 , was accused of running a $ 7million Ponzi scheme .
The Silver , the former Speaker of the New York State Assembly , was charged in January for allegedly taking $ 4million in brides and kickbacks .
Trebitshe is married to Silver 's daughter Michelle .
