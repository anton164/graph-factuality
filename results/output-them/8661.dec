 David Cameron pledged to deliver effective ` home rule ' for England - giving MPs the same powers to set tax rates which have been agreed for Scotland following last year 's independent referendum .
Mr Cameron said in the interests of fairness English MPs must be given a veto on legislation no longer applies in Scotland .
It will mean English , Welsh and Northern Irish MPs being able to set a separate rate of income tax for England .
