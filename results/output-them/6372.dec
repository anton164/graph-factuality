 Holly Barber , from Manchester , woke up feeling unwell and with chest and neck pains -- but chalked it down to heavy drinking .
She rushed to hospital , where doctors found 13 pulmonary embolisms , blood clots blocking the main artery of her lungs , killing the tissue .
She was horrified to be told the blockage was so big she was probably days from death .
She has given blood-thinning medication to prevent future clots .
