 Researchers have created a sensor that can recognise the unique shape of your ear , your palm or any other body part you want to access your device .
Called Bodyprint , the technology turns a standard touchscreen into a biometric scanner removing the need to specialist hardware such as fingerprint readers .
Details of its algorithm are included in their paper , Bodyprint : Biometric User Identification on Mobile Devices on Scan Body Parts .
