 a new study based on 1,000 years of temperature records .
The research claims that natural variability in surface temperatures over the course of a decade can account for increases and dips in warming rates .
But it adds that these so-called ` climate wiggles ' could cause planet to warm up much faster than anticipated .
Duke-led study says that variability is caused by interactions between the ocean and atmosphere .
