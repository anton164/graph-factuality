 British-born stall-holder Tania Rahman , 27 , was asked by Salisbury City Council if she wanted to run a stand at the celebration .
But when she asked to be counted in she was told her stall , Chit Chaat Chai , would not be allowed because it is not ` English-themed .
The council has now apologised for the letter to inviting English themed food only .
