Veterinarians have criticised EU rules on organic farming that demands that fish are treated with homoeopathic remedies .
In line with EU regulations , the first line of treatment for organic fish should be ` substances from plants , animals or minerals in a homeopathic dilution to treat .
British and Norwegian vets have called the directives ` scientifically illiterate , saying the use of homeopathy could lead to ` serious animal health and welfare detriment .
