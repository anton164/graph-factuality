 Shauna McGlasson , 25 , was so overweight she got trapped in the turnstiles at the Alice And Wonderland ride at Blackpool Pleasure Beach in August .
Shauna , who was a takeaway addict , was carrying her three-year-old daughter Lacey in her arms and the toddler started screaming after her mother tried to free herself .
She lost seven stone and now dropped seven stone in as many months .
