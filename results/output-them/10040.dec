Amazon has won approval from U.S. federal regulators to test the latest version of its delivery drone outdoors , less than a month after the e-commerce powerhouse blasted regulators for being slow to approve commercial drone testing .
The Federal Aviation Administration had earlier given the green light to an Amazon prototype drone in March , but the company told the prototype had already become obsolete while it waited more than six months for the agency 's permission .
FAA granted Amazon 's request to test its new delivery drones in a letter .
