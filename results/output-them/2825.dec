The largest single high-definition map of mysterious dark matter will eventually allow a 3D view of dark matter across one eighth of the night sky .
And the map shows clumps of mystery particles across 0.4 per cent of the sky .
The goal is to eventually map 12.5 per cent over five years .
Red here shows more dark matter , and blue shows less .
