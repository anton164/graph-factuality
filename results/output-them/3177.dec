Tons of rotting fish have filled a lagoon in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil where Olympic rowing and canoeing events will be held during next year 's Games .
Over the past week , thousands of the silver fish have been scooped out of Rodrigo de Freitas lake , but city authorities and biologists have argued about the cause .
Rubbish collectors will continue to rake the fish , a small silvery species called twaite shad , off the water 's surface .
