Officer Michael Slager has received a visit from his mother and pregnant wife in prison for the first time since he was charged with fatally shooting Walter Scott .
Slager , 33 , is being kept in isolation and can not walk down a hall in Charleston County Jail without the cell block being cleared first .
But on Friday , his wife Jamie , who is eight-and-a-half months pregnant and his mother Karen Sharpe were allowed to speak to him .
His attorney Andy Savage told Slager is housed in a room with one window and does not interact with other detainees at jail .
