 Rugby School is known as the spiritual home of the game , with the World Cup trophy named the Webb Ellis Cup in honour of the schoolboy called William who made the daring decision to disregard the rules in 1823 .
Today the school is still steeped in the traditions of the sport , alongside its own rich history of ` muscular Christianity .
Dr Thomas Arnold is credited with transforming Rugby School 's values .
