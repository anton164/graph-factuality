Pakistan all-rounder Mohammad Hafeez is free to resume bowling in international cricket after remedial work and a re-test on his action .
Off-spinner Hafeez , 34 , was banned from bowling after being reported for a suspect action five months ago in the first Test against New Zealand and failing an initial test on its legality .
But the International Cricket Council confirmed his action has been proven legal in Chennai this month .
