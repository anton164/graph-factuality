Ed Balls was left briefly stumped by a basic maths question today after he gave a speech in Leeds .
Asked what seven times six equals , Labour 's shadow chancellor looked down at his feet and laughed nervously before eventually answering correctly following a ten second pause .
Mr Balls said he still relies on his mother-in-law for help with maths .
He to say he had not been asked any maths questions live on TV .
