Dallas Cowboys defensive end Greg Hardy has been suspended without pay for 10 games for conduct detrimental to the National Football League .
The decision to ban Hardy , who last played for the Carolina Panthers followed a two-month NFL investigation that started after the dismissal of his domestic violence case in February .
Domestic violence charges against Hardy were abruptly dropped in February after his accuser could not be found to testify .
