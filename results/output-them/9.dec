 The Prevention of Terrorism Act - passed in the capital Kuala Lumpur yesterday - officially enables authorities to detain suspected terrorists for two years without charge or trial .
But it also allows for the authorities to apply for unlimited extensions after those two years expire .
The bill effectively reintroduces the controversial prospect of indefinite detention without trial in Malaysia .
