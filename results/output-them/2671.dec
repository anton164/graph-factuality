 A new London based campaign from Rape Crisis London has captured hundreds of women across London in various outfits to point out that no matter what they choose to wear they are not asking to be raped .
The Rape Crisis Crisis aims to stamp out any suggestion that a woman can be blamed for her attack because of her choice in clothing .
