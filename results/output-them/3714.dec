 The images were taken in Jervis Bay , the south coast of NSW , as the neon glow illuminated one of Australia 's popular beaches .
Photographer Andy Hutchinson described the sight as a ` beautiful supernatural scene ' caused by millions of plankton omitting light .
A similar display was shown in Sydney 's Manly Beach back in August 2014 .
