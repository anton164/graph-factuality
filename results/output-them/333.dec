 Curt Almond , 26 , from Bristol , spent at least Â£ 40 a week buying new Calvin Klein boxers so that he could slip into a new ` crisp pair ' every day of the week .
But after wiping out most of his savings , Mr Almond realised that it was ` bankruptcy or boxers .
He has now reverted back to the bankruptcy of wearing and washing his boxers - and has saved himself off his addiction .
