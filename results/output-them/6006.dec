Roma have been ordered to close part of their stadium for their next home game after supporters were sanctioned for showing an offensive banner over the weekend .
The banner , displayed during Roma 's 1-0 defeat of Napoli on Saturday , caused outcry for insulting the mother of a Napoli fan who was killed in violent clashes last year .
Roma will have part of stadium closed for game against Atalanta on April 19 .
