 Joanne Whitehouse , 44 , had applied for her four-year-old daughter Alice to go to St John Fisher 's RC School in Middleton near Rochdale as her only preference .
Her sons Joel , nine , Harri , and Ollie , six , already attend the school and she believed there would be ` no issue ' with her daughter gaining a place .
Jo Whitehouse 's granddaughter Olivia was told there were 82 applications for just 30 places at the school this year .
She is planning to appeal Roch 's decision .
