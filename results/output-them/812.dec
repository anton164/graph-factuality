 The Rosehall Estate near Inverness boasts a 22-room main house along with 700 acres of land and five separate out buildings .
It was built in the 1820 but its most colourful period of its history was during the 1920s after it was bought by Hugh ` Bendor ' Grosvenor , the Duke of Westminster .
The house has not been lived in for more than 60 years .
Miss Chanel would love to fish on the estate 's river .
