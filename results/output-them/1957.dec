Media personality Miranda Devine has apologised after calling a rugby player a ` tosser ' for celebrating a try using sign language .
Flanker David Pocock scored a hat-trick of tries for Australian Super Rugby team , the Brumbies on Friday night .
Devine tweeted : ` Did Pocock actually do jazz hands when he celebrated a try ?
.
But it was n't the hand shaking gesture that 's become popular recently - the flanker and former Australian captain was actually doing sign language for a friend .
