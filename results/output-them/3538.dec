One Nation leader Pauline Hanson went on the attack on Sunday saying that imposing halal certification on Australians was wrong , while defending the anti-Islam protests across the country .
Speaking on the Today show , Ms Hanson described halalal certification as a ` profit , money-making racket ' and that the public were being ` hoodwinked over the issue .
She also said the protests on Saturday were about ` criticism , not racism .
Ms Hanson says an investigation was needed into halalal certification in Australia .
