 Eva Mozes Kor , 81 , who embraced Oskar Groening in court last week called for the prosecutions of former SS officers to end .
By doing so she faced criticism from her co-plaintiffs in the case who suggested she should not have taken part in the trial in Germany .
She argued that any Nazis still alive should not forgive Mr Groening for his murders .
