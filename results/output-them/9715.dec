A man , wearing an orange high-vis jacket , could be seen leaning out the sliding door of the black Vauxhall Vivaro van as it hurtled down the M40 near Oxford .
He appeared to be laughing and making jokes with his colleagues inside the KJ Rail van as he hung his body - and even a leg - out of the vehicle .
Today his boss has called the man in for a disciplinary hearing .
