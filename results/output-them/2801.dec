 Bryan Santana , 20-year-old pizza delivery driver on trial for stabbing and strangling his roommate to death before having sex with her corpse was found guilty of first-degree murder on Thursday and sentenced to two life terms in prison .
The Florida court heard how Bryan Santana was living out some kind of sick fantasy when he removed all the lightbulbs of the Orlando home he shared with Shelby Fazio , 23 , before waiting for the young woman to return , killing her and then abusing her body .
He then killed and mutilated her dog , and wrote messages in blood on the wall .
The trial of Santana has ` no glimmer of humanity .
