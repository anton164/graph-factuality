 Online fitness company Protein World caused a Twitter storm recently with its London Underground poster of a genetically-blessed model in a small yellow bikini , asking : ` Are you beach body ready ?
.
The poster , promoting weight loss came under fire from feminists and body image campaigners who branded the campaign body-shaming and called for the offending images to be removed .
Transport for London are in the process of removing the ad , and now with their own version of the poster .
