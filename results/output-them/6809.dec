Prince Andrew will not face court action in the US over claims he had sex with an under-age girl , after a Florida judge ruled her claims must be struck out .
Virginia Roberts had hoped to join a lawsuit involving Andrew 's friend Jeffrey Epstein , a convicted paedophile and sex offender .
But Judge Kenneth Marra ordered her claims that she was a ` sex slave ' to Epstein and was forced to have sex with the Duke of York three times should be struck from the record .
