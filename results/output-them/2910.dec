A new Kansas law tells poor families that they ca n't use cash assistance from the state to attend concerts , go swimming , visit theme parks or buy lingerie .
More than 20 other states have such lists .
But the one included by the Republican-dominated Kansas Legislature in a bill that GOP Gov.
Sam Brownback planned to sign Thursday appears to be the most exhaustive .
The new restrictions is part of a broader welfare law taking effect in July .
