An exotic animal owner from Ohio is campaigning for his bear and big cats to be returned after they were seized by the state in January .
In total , six tigers , a bear , a lion , a cougar , a black leopard and a liger were taken from Kenny Hetrick 's Stony Ridge farm after it was found he did not have the correct permit and cages were ` unsafe .
Authorities have also started cracking down on the owners of wild creatures following an incident in 2011 where a man in eastern Ohio released 56 exotic animals and tigers - then killed himself .
