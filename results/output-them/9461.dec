Sophie English was one of thousands of babies who was born at the height of the Vietnam War and adopted by an Australian family .
There has been very little information to help Ms English find her birth mother who made the heartbreaking decision to give her up and for 40 years she has had questions about her mother .
She was finally given a chance to find closure with ABC 's Foreign Correspondent reporter Sally Sara who travelled with her to Vietnam .
The last time Ms English had seen her home country was when she was 10 months old .
