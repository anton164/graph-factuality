 Scientists have developed a device that clips onto the smartphone and could even be used at home .
Their device uses the powerful cameras available now on most smartphones in combination with tiny beads that bind to cancerous cells .
Using a smartphone app these images can then be sent to a central computer for analysis and then the result returned in less than 45 minutes .
