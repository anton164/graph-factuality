 The boy , known only as Hanghang , was using the old handset as an alarm when he woke up early for school and started to play with it .
He said the phone felt hot and then blew up in his face , exposing part of his jawbone and embedding fragments in his arms and legs .
He is being treated in Ping Mei Group Hospital and is expected to need several operations to repair the damage .
