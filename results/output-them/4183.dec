 Tony Hatch and Jackie Trent , who were married for more than three decades , were dubbed ` Mr and Mrs Music after composing for artists including Frank Sinatra , Dean Martin , Scott Walker .
So when Trent died last month aged 74 after a long battle with cancer , Hatch was expected to be at her funeral to say a final goodbye .
But Hatch was banned from the funeral by Trent 's second husband , Colin Gregory , who accuses the composer of breaking his wife 's heart .
