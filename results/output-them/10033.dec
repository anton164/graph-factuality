 Maurice Thibaux , 67 , caused a stir at Sunday night 's opening show held at the Carriageworks in Eveleigh - in Sydney 's inner city .
The French native lives next door to the venue - crashed the stage to make a complaint about the noise , he claims was ` similar to a jumbo jet taking off your head .
Mr Thibaux says he was ` very sorry ' to have disturbed the show .
