Leeds Rhinos have sent full back Zak Hardaker on an anger management course after a student was left with two black eyes and bruising during a violent incident in February .
Hardaker was at the centre of a police assault probe into an attack on a 22-year-old man at student flats in Leeds .
Leeds issued a five-match ban and a fine for a homophobic comment made last year .
