 The High Court ruled today that that that United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust must pay in excess of Â£ 14.6 million for birth injuries , after failing to carry out a Caesarean section on Suzanne Adams and properly monitor her during labour .
The hospital 's negligence led to her son James Robshaw , now 12 , being born with cerebral palsy .
