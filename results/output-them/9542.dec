 The seven-car Maglev - short for ` magnetic levitation ' hit a top speed of 375mph -LRB- 603 km/h and travelled for almost 11 seconds at speeds above 373mph near Mount Fuji .
The run beat last week 's speeds of 366mph - 366kph , beat the train 's previous 12-year record .
The train is able to go this fast because it makes use of a charge to lift the carriages above the rail .
