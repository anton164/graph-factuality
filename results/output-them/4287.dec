Labour leader Harold Wilson secretly lobbied the BBC to change the time of popular comedy Steptoe and Son on the night of the 1964 election because he feared working class voters would stay at home and watch the show .
Mr Wilson went to the home of BBC Director General Sir Hugh Greene and told him the show could cost him 20 seats .
The BBC is releasing an archive interview with Sir Hugh recorded in 1982 and a 1981 interview with the former Prime Minister .
