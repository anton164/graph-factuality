ABC is filming a pilot episode of The Muppet Show , in the hopes of bringing the beloved variety show back to the small screen .
The network has asked Big Bang Theory co-creator Bill Prady to mastermind the revival , which would see the return of Kermit the Frog , Miss Piggy , Fozzie Bear and other old favorites .
New Muppets TV content has n't been since since Muppetets Tonight ended in 1998 .
