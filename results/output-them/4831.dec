 Jonathon Keats , a San Francisco writer and self-described experimental philosopher and conceptual artist has designed a ` millennium camera ' that he intends to mount in a churchless steeple on a college campus .
He hopes the resulting photograph will chronicle climate change by taking a 1,000-year exposure of a mountain range .
The camera will create one image that Keats says will display centuries of changes to the environment .
