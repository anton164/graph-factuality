Michael Olsen , 52 , from Dartford , Kent , was challenged by PCs Mark Bird and Robert Wilson after abandoning his car in the road after ploughing into a traffic island and parked cars .
He ignored officers who were pursuing him by car but when they got out he pulled a gun to PC Wilson 's head .
When PC Bird lunged at Olsen in a bid to save his colleague he felt a sharp pain through his hand and realised he had been shot .
