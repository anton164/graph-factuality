 Biologists have studied the healing process at a molecular level using electron microscopes to examine skin as it repairs itself .
They found skin cells appear to attach to each other using tiny tubes that pull them together so they interlock like a zip .
The researchers hope their findings could help in the development of new treatments for wounds .
