 The fireball was captured on camera on Sunday by the United Kingdom Meteor Observing Network -LRB- UKMON -RRB- in Portadown , County Armagh .
Footage shows it glowing brightly as it races northwards towards the Irish Sea .
UKMON said that pieces from an asteroid in orbit between Mars and Jupiter would have crashed to Earth and could be worth thousands of pounds .
