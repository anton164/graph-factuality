 James Hayward had arrived at East Midlands Airport with his parents , Phil , and Hazel , 38 with his brightly coloured toy - packed in his hand luggage for their flight to Lanzarote .
But security officers took exception to James 's harmless toy when it was picked up on the system 's X-ray machines .
Dad Phil has labelled the security checks ` ludicrous .
