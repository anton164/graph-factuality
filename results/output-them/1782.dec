 Claudia Martins , 33 , wept as she walked free after a judge accepted she had a ` momentary abnormality of mental functioning ' which she no longer suffered from .
A court heard she was suffering from a condition known as a ` pathological denial of pregnancy ' which continued after giving birth to a baby girl .
Until she had managed to keep her pregnancy secret from her family and gave birth to the child in the bath before killing her .
She was cleared of murder but convicted of manslaughter .
