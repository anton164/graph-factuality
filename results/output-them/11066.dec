 Pippa Middleton has been slammed for ` promoting the cruel and unnecessary whaling industry .
She boasted of tucking into the delicacy in Norway , to the horror of environmental campaigners who say she is helping promote an ` unimaginably cruel ' trade .
Ms Middleton says she ate whale carpaccio-style at the Juvet Landscape Hotel in north-west Norway .
The hunting and importation of whale meat is banned in Britain .
