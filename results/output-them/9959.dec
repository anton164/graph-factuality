 Veteran broadcaster Peter Alliss has said legislation designed to stop golf clubs from discriminating against female members has prompted a decline in women 's membership .
Some clubs had only allowed female members if they played at restricted times in return for a discounted membership fee .
But the Equality Act 2010 ruled that women must now have equal access and pay the same membership rates as men .
