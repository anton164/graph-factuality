 Pritesh , 36 and Mansi Gandhi , 35 , started trying for a baby ten years ago but repeatedly lost the baby due to a medical condition .
Mansi , from Feltham , London , did manage to become pregnant and gave birth in 2007 but Khushi was so premature he died after a six-month fight for life .
However P Pesh 's sister Hiral Shah , 32 , stepped in and offered to carry the couple 's baby after a 20-minute labour .
