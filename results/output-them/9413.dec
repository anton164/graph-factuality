 A federal court of appeals threw out the career home run leader 's obstruction of justice conviction on Wednesday , ruling 10-1 that his meandering answer before a grand jury in 2003 was not material to the government 's investigation into illegal steroids distribution .
On April 22 , 2015 , reversed the sole conviction against Barry Bonds and said he could not be tried again on an obstruction probe charge .
Bonds was convicted of the obstruction charge in 2011 .
