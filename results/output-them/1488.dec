Trainer Roger Varian insists he has not lost faith in Belardo after the 2014 Dewhurst Stakes winner beat in Saturday 's Greenham Stakes .
But Varian 's determination to keep the son of Lope De Vega away from the fast ground at Newbury means the colt looks more likely to head to the French 2,000 Guineas rather than the British equivalent at Newmarket on May 2 .
Richard Hannon says Tiggy Wiggy is likely to miss the 1,000ineas on May 3 .
