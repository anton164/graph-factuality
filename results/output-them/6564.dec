State Education Minister Adrian Piccoli has called the Scot 's College university shortcut ` unfair , ' after it was released that school students could buy their way into university without completing their HSC .
The University of Sydney have been running a 17-week diploma for Year 11 students at Scot 11s College to skip their year 12 exams and ` buy ' their entry into the sandstone university .
The program was devised by the university 's commercial arm .
