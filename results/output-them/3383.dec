 Lucian Faggiano bought the building in Lecce , Puglia in the south of Italy and had planned to turn it into a trattoria - but renovations were put on hold when he discovered a toilet on the site was blocked .
And while attempting to fix the toilet he dug into a Messapian tomb built 2,000 years ago , a Romaniscan chapel , and etchings from the Knights Templar .
The search for the pipe began at the turn of the millennium .
