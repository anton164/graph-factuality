 astronomers believe the bright light in the sky that triggered the conversion of Paul the Apostle may have been a falling meteor 2,000 years ago .
They say descriptions of Paul 's experience - in which he was blinded for three days after seeing a bright light - match accounts of the fireball that streaked across the sky above Chelyabinsk in Russia in 2013 .
A meteor that blazed across southern Urals in February was the largest recorded meteor strike in more than a century .
