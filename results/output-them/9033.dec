 Kate Roberts , 24 , noticed her son Miles had a slightly different shaped head when he was born , and at three months , he was diagnosed with brachycephaly , also known as ` flat head syndrome .
This when the back of the head becomes flattened , causing the front of the skull to bulge out .
Doctors believe it is caused by babies sleeping on their back , and the NHS does not pay for treatment .
Instead parents are advised to move their children on to their stomachs during the day .
