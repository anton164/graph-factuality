 Seven-year-old Charlotte Briggs was told she can not attend Lydgate Junior School in Sheffield even though she can see it from her bedroom window .
Her mother Lynne , 49 , claims taking her daughter to school and back would require four hours of travelling on the bus .
Mrs Briggs is to appeal the decision after Charlotte was given a spot at Shooters Grove Primary - more than two miles away .
