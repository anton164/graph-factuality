European human rights judges undermined the idea that no foreigner should be thrown out of a country if it will interfere with their right to a family life .
Eight judges of the European Court of Human Rights found that Russia was justified in deporting a 45-year-old man for breaking immigration laws even though he went to live there more than 20 years ago and has a Russian wife and son .
It the Russian authorities had not breached any human rights rules when they deported him in 2011 .
