Rescue workers tasked with freeing almost 100 dogs that had been kept locked up in a blacked-out barn in Tennessee this week say they were met with fear .
The dogs , who had been living in complete darkness , were found last Saturday in the barn in Manchester ; many emaciated , ` living in several inches of their own waste ' and close to death .
The property owner , identified as 64-year-old Caroline Irby , was charged with 10 counts of animal cruelty on Monday .
