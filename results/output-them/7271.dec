President Barack Obama said likely Republican presidential candidate Scott Walker , in an interview airing this morning .
Responding to Walker 's claims that he 'd ` absolutely ' cancel or ` disown ' a deal with Iran on ` day one ' if elected to , Obama told NPR Morning Edition host Steve Inskeep that such an approach ` would be foolish .
Walker fired back at Obama on Twitter , saying ` Americans would be better served by a President .
Obama 's jab at Walker departed from the White House 's general strategy .
