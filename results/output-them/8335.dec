 10 tonne ` fatberg ' made up of congealed waste has been removed from a sewer underneath one of London 's most exclusive streets .
The enormous lump , which was 40 metres long and made up fat and wet wipes was so heavy that it caused the 1940s sewer in Chelsea to break .
Now a Â£ 400,000 repair is being carried out to repair the broken sewer .
