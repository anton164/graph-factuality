Wilfried Zaha has admitted he felt ` worthless during his two-year spell as a Manchester United player after his move to Old Trafford .
The 22-year-old winger was signed by then Old Trafford boss Sir Alex Ferguson in January 2013 from Crystal Palace for Â£ 10million .
But the terms of the transfer saw him loan back to the Eagles for the remainder of the season .
Zaha made just four United appearances for Crystal Palace .
