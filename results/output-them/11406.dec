Investigators have now rescued 550 fisherman slaves from a remote Indonesian island after returning to the scene of an earlier rescue to check nobody was left behind .
A dramatic rescue earlier in the week led to 210 mainly-Burmese nationals being identified , the vast majority of whom were desperate to leave the island village of Benjina .
The report traced slave-caught seafood from there to Thailand where it can then enter the supply chains of U.S. .
