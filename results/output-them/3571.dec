 for the first time , scientists have joined these individual 30 to 60 mile -LRB- 50 to 100 km -RRB- map to create a single complete 3D map .
The new map allows astronomers to ` stand ' on planetary surfaces and could help explain how water and lava once flowed across the red planet .
The colour-coded terrain models show the height of the Meridiani Planum region at up to 820ft of the surface .
