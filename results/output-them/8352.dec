An inventor Eason Chow believes his innovative new product could be the solution - and found inspiration from the sugar-coated sweets in gumball machines .
It involves covering coffee granules in milk powder then dipping the whole lot in sugar to create a revolutionary capsule with no waste created .
Mr Chow says the coffee pods will cost around £ 4 for a pack of 20 and the machine will cost £ 80 .
