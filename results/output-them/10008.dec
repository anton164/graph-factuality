 Peter Thurston , 80 , takes his vessel , dubbed the ` catamavan ' , , out on the River Swale in Kent regularly and enjoys the views of the countryside .
He says his small yachts were too cramped for leisure cruising and he could n't buy a bigger vessel , so he built the caravan boat to take his mind off his divorce .
Peter says he spent Â£ 4,000 building the hull .
