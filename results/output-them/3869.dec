Items on sale in Poundland are sometimes up to 50 per cent more expensive than those sold in supermarkets .
The budget retailer last week announced that sales exceed Â£ 1billion for the first time last year becoming Europe 's largest discount retailer .
The company 's success has been put down to shoppers hunting bargains and taking sales away from Britain 's four big supermarkets , Asda , Tesco and Morrisons .
Poundland has snowballed from a small private enterprise into a High Street revolution .
