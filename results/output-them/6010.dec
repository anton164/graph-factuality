 The unnamed 20-year-old woman was driving on the I-25 in Weld County , north of Denver , when her window shattered and she felt bleeding from both sides of her neck .
In a chilling 911 call from around 11 pm Wednesday night , she was bleeding from my neck .
She was taken to hospital where she had been shot clean through the neck .
The woman is expected to recover .
