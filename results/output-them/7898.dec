 Anna Moser 's daughter Sharista Giles of Sweetwater , Tennessee , was driving home from a concert in December with friends when a car accident sent her to the hospital with injuries so bad doctors believed she would never recover .
She was five months pregnant at the time and in January doctors were forced to deliver the baby early , a little boy the family has named Leighton Isiah Giles .
Giles was given a two-per cent chance of recovery .
