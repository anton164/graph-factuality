Hundreds of tourists had to be evacuated from Warwick Castle after a flaming cannonball set alight to a medieval thatched building during a display .
Holidaymakers had gathered to watch the cannonball be fired from the wooden trebuchet -- the largest working siege machine in the world .
However the big display ended in catastrophe when sparks from the fireball ignited the roof of a nearby ancient boathouse , causing it to erupt into flames .
