 Little Zane Gbangbola died at home -- in the middle of the night -- after being poisoned by gas .
For months after his death , police insisted carbon monoxide from a faulty pump hired by his family had caused his death .
But authorities have known for 14 months that hydrogen cyanide gas capable of killing Zane had leaked into the family 's home as it was engulfed by floodwater .
