 builders in China have constructing a mountain road thousands of feet above the ground in Pingjiang County , Hunan province .
With no ropes or safety harnesses , and only hard hats to protect them if they fall , these men spend their days hauling heavy planks and wheelbarrows full of cement over a rickety wooden walkway .
Chinese officials hope the road will draw thousands more tourists to the area .
