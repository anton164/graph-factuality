Police in Maryland are hunting for a ` heartless ' thief who stole a four-year-old boy 's wheelchair in the night .
The youngster 's mother left the buggy in the lobby of their building on Merrimac Drive , Langley Park , as usual on Sunday evening since it 's easier to carry her son to their second floor apartment .
But when she went to retrieve the stroller , it had disappeared .
Prince George 's County Police have released a surveillance footage which shows a person pushing the empty chair in a parking lot .
