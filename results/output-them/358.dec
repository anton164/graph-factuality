Ben Crenshaw will mark his 44th and last consecutive appearance in the Masters by standing in for Arnold Palmer in the traditional par-three tournament at Augusta National .
Palmer is unable to play alongside Gary Player and Jack Nicklaus in the curtain-raising event on Wednesday afternoon as he recovers from a dislocated shoulder .
The winner of the par three contest has never gone on to win the Masters .
