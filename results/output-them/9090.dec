 three-and-a-half minute video , titled ` Never letting him book a hotel again .
With scenes reminiscent of The Inbetweeners films , the video was created by Patrick Miller and his friend , Damien , who stayed at the family-run hotel last week .
The deep end of the swimming pool at the hotel was filled with green sludge , dead insects and debris .
