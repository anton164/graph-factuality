 The 18-year-old , who was booked into Lower Buckeye Jail in Phoenix two weeks ago , is seen on surveillance video walking in a room he was not authorized to be in before being approached by two officers .
Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio said that the jail employees began telling the young man to go back to his cell before he began taking swings at them .
The inmate was not immediately affected by four taser shots and used a Taser .
Scott Beaty , a 15-year , was taken to the psychiatric ward .
