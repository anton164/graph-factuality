Saudi prince Alwaleed bin Talal has pledged to give a free Bentley to Saudi pilots who took part in air strikes against rebels advancing in Yemen .
Saudi Arabian forces launched air strikes on Yemen a month ago to stop advances from the Shiite Houthi rebels , who are allied with Iran and previously overthrew the Saudi-backed government .
Prince Talal , who owns $ 300 million stake in Twitter , made the pledge on social media .
