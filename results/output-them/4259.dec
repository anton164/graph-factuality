An obscure agreement struck by state governments in 1993 means the vast majority of Australians will not get a day off .
Under the pact , no public holiday is triggered when Anzac Day falls on a Saturday , .
The agreement was designed to provide uniformity of public holidays across the nation .
If Easter , Christmas , Australia Day , Queen 's Birthday or Labour Day fall on a weekend , a holiday is granted on a weekday .
