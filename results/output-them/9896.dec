 Heather Mack , 19 , brutally killed Sheila von Wiese-Mack with the help of her boyfriend in August and dumped the bloody suitcase in a taxi outside the upscale St. Regis Bali Resort .
Mack avoided the death penalty last week when a judge sentenced her to 10 years , a relatively light sentence .
Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran have spent the past decade on death row after they were convicted of trying to smuggle heroin from Bali to Australia in 2005 .
