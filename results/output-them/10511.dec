 Digby was abandoned on the street next to a set of bins .
At just over a month old and weighing less than 1 lb , he was freezing cold and close to death .
Fortunately he was rescued by the RSPCA and taken to their Southridge centre in Hertfordshire - where he quickly became inseparable from 9st mastiff Nero .
But staff at the centre say he has been revived and finding Digby 's owner .
