 The converted four-bedroom home on Lawrenny Court was built as a garage to service the 57-room mansion Homeden , home to Supreme Court Justice Sir Henry Hodges and found their fortune in the manufacture of the drug Aspro .
The conversion took place at the same time Homeden was being tuned into a block of flats .
The owners say the property will fetch $ 3.5 million on auction day .
