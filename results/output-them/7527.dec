A trucker has been caught on camera launching an extraordinary foul-mouthed tirade at another motorist after a crash along the M6 .
In footage shot from a dashboard camera on Sunday , the trucker lets rip after a car towing a caravan moves into his lane and the two vehicles collide .
Eventually the car jackknifes , coming to rest across the front of the van , blocking the slip road .
