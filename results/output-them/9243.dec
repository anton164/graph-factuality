 Billy Mitchell , now seven , was born with Apert syndrome , a rare condition which left him with malformations of the skull , face , hands and feet .
He endured a series of major operations to correct the deformities -- which included a procedure to crack open and reshape his skull and rebuild his features .
He also had a titanium frame drilled into his head , which was left there for nine weeks .
Billy 's parents say he had his new face .
