President Barack Obama is calling for an end to psychiatric therapy treatments aimed at changing the sexual orientation or gender identity of gay , lesbian and transgender youth .
The move comes in response to an online petition posted on the White House website following the death of 17-year-old Leelah Alcorn .
The petition currently has over 120,000 signatures .
White House is not explicitly calling for Congressional legislation to ban the therapies nationwide .
