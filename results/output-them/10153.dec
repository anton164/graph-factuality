The brave man who stood up against a neo-Nazi at an anti-Islam rally has spoken out about the moment .
During the Reclaim Australia rallies on the Easter weekend , anti-racism protester Jacob King was snapped staring into the eyes of a bald man with a swastika tattooed behind his ear .
Mr King was raised in Melbourne and says he lived in a multicultural part of Melbourne capital where he learned Islamophobic views .
