 Kathleen Bailey , 70 , a church elder and avid charity fundraiser , was given power of attorney over her terminally ill 87-year-old friend 's finances .
Bailey later became a carer for her victim , who was battling breast cancer and had no children .
But the grandmother , from Ramsbottom , Greater Manchester helped herself to at least Â£ 1,500 and used the money to finance trips to north Wales .
She was handed a 12-month suspended jail sentence after admitting a charge of theft at Bolton Crown Court .
