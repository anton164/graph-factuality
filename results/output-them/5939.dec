An arrest warrant has been issued for disgraced AFL premiership player Ben Cousins after he failed to appear in a Perth court on traffic offences .
Cousins , 36 , has been on bail and was due to face Fremantle Magistrates Court on Wednesday morning but he did not appear .
His lawyer claimed the former West Coast Eagles captain had conflicting medical appointments , but the court requires a hard copy .
Cousins has twice been hospitalised for an arrest warrant .
