 Army psychiatrist Major Nidal Hasan opened fire on November 5 , 2009 , killing 13 men and women at the military post in Killeen , Texas , injuring 30 others before he was shot himself .
Authorities initially classed the mass murder as ` workplace violence ' but it has since been acknowledged that the attack was inspired by a foreign terrorist group .
But one victim claims he is still going without certain benefits after the Military rejected his injuries were sustained in the line of duty .
