 Baroness Hale of Richmond said she wanted to see the bitterness taken out of most matrimonial disputes so a person does not need to be held at fault in order to obtain a divorce .
Divorcing couples currently have to cite one of five reasons : adultery ; unreasonable behaviour or five years ' separation without consent .
Lady Hale also wants couples to be made to sort out arrangements for children and money before divorce .
