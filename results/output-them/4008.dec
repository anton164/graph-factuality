 Tessa Cunningham , Cunningham puts a host of our favourite foods to the frozen test .
The gooey deliciousness of a cake fresh out of the oven is unbeatable but they can dry out and get stale .
Freeze your cake for 24 hours straight from the oven and the sponge will be bouncier than ever .
Keeping fresh herbs in the freezer will intensify their flavour .
