 Marc Carn , 29 , from Plymouth , was drinking in an Irish bar with ten friends near to Las Ramblas on Saturday night when he suddenly disappeared .
After he failed to turn up for his flight back home , Mr Carn 's family contacted the Foreign Office in a bid to track him down .
But the 29-year-old handed himself into the British Consulate - having walked for two days to get back to Barcelona .
