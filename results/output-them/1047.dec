 Revellers in the remote village in Jharkhand state tie themselves upside down onto a wooden pole that hand hangs just feet above a raging fire .
Locals believe the unusual practice helps protect the village from drought and disease , and no reports of those being injured .
The annual fire festival lasts for 11 days and sees dozens of participants dangle over the flames while a Hindu priest uses oil to stoke the blaze .
