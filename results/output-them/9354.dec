 the Ecuador tourist board saw it fool a group of 40 visitors into thinking they had flown to Costa Rica to enjoy the delights of its famous port town Golfito .
But the group of tourists were exploring the activities in the country 's Napo Province , in the Amazon rainforest .
The creative prank was executed by the Ecuadorean airline Tame , Ecuador 's Tourism Ministry and Ministry of Transport and Public Works .
