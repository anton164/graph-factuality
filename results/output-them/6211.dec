 The secret Ukip-commissioned poll , leaked to The Mail on Sunday shows that Farage has fallen behind his Tory opponent in the Kent seat he is contesting .
And he is in danger of finishing third , with Labour catching up fast .
If the poll is accurate , it could end Farage 's political career as he has vowed to resign as Ukip leader if he fails to win South Thanet .
