 Toya Graham , a single mother-of-six , was caught on camera whacking her 16-year-old son Michael , pulling off his ski mask and chasing him down the street as rioters clashed with police , looted stores and cars .
The riots broke out following the death of Freddie Gray earlier this month who died of a spinal cord injury after being taken by Baltimore police .
Miss Graham says she ` lost it ' when she saw Michael 's riots .
