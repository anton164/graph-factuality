Jeremy Clarkson , James May and Richard Hammond today held talks with Top Gear executive producer Andy Wilman - just hours before it was sensationally announced he had quit the BBC .
The resignation marks another blow for the show , since Clarkson was axed last month following a ` fracas ' with a producer .
Mr Wilman is now free to reunite with the team on a rival channel .
