 Genetic analysis of two woolly mammoth remains show that their population became so small that they had become chronically inbred .
The last of the woolly mammoths were isolated on an Arctic island for around 5,000 years , forcing them to inbreed as their population dwindled 4,500 years ago .
Researchers have concluded that the creatures clung on in a tiny pocket of the Arctic , on an island .
The study has raised the prospect of bringing the giant mammal back to life using cloning techniques with modern elephants .
