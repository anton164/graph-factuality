 Patrick Revins , 49 , sold £ 10-worth of the Class A drug , which was hidden in a Kinder Egg , to the policeman in November 2013 .
The detective was easily able to identify who sold him the drugs - as Revins has ` P ' and ` R ' tattooed on either side of his forehead .
Revins admitted one count of supplying heroin and was sentenced to a year in jail .
