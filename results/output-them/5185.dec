An Australian couple who abandoned a boy born in a surrogacy deal in India were repeatedly told the child would be left stateless .
The FOI documents staff at the Australian High Commission in India and Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade were aware the couple was from New South Wales , where it is illegal to enter into international surrogacy arrangements .
The couple travelled to India in late 2012 and seeked citizenship for a baby girl but India does not recognise surrogate children as citizens .
