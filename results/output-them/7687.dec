A plane carrying former England rugby captain Lewis Moody was forced to make an emergency landing in the Arctic .
As poor visibility struck between Svalbard and ice camp Barneo on Saturday , the pilot made the decision to bring the plane down , and due to the bumpy landing was damaged .
Moody , 36 , is undertaking a 100 km trek to the North Pole to raise Â£ 250,000 for charity , and his fellow trekkers were unharmed .
