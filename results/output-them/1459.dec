Self-styled ` anarchist libertarian ' squatters have set up camp in one of London 's most historic monuments and unfurled banners reading ` Homes for all .
The protesters mounted Admiralty Arch , which joins Trafalgar Square with the Mall , and called for others to join them .
It is not clear what their protest is attempting to highlight , as a garbled message posted on Facebook by the group calls for ` Christmas lights ... and ` radical/revolutionary messages .
