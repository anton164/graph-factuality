 Audrey Dimitrew , 16 , of Virginia accepted a spot on the under-16 Chantilly Juniors in November believing she would get playing time , but was told by coaches she did not have the skills to compete with her team .
The sophomore at Woodgrove High School and her family sued the Chesapeake Region Volleyball Association on March 10 after she was accepted to another club but was denied the transfer .
The lawsuit seeks to let Audrey transfer clubs and asks for attorney fees .
