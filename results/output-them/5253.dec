 The ` goblins ' are scientifically known as ` hoodoos ' - rock protrusions consisting of relatively soft rock topped by harder stone that preserves each column 's spire-like shape from weather erosion .
But the softer rock has been removed by wind and water , leaving thousands of unique constructions , chiselled by water and dust erosion .
The site is tiny to state parks .
