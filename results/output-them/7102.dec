A worrying new trend dubbed the ' #kyliejenjenner ' is sweeping social media , encouraging teens to blow their lips up to epic proportions using bottles or shot glasses .
The method involves participants placing their mouth over the opening of a cup , jar or other narrow vessel and sucking in until the air vacuum causes their lips to swell up - all in the hopes of emulating Kylie Jenner 's bee-stung pout .
Countless teens , both boys and girls have been sharing the results of their experiments on Twitter and Instagram .
