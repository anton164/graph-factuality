A former Davis High School teacher accused of having sex with three of her male students took a plea deal Wednesday to avoid a trial .
One of the boys was 16 and two were 17 when they were having sex during Davis Brianne Altice , 35 .
One testified that he considered her to be his girlfriend during their yearlong tryst .
But the boys were all minors and Utah law also says a person can not consent to sex if the other person is in a position of special trust .
She could face up to 45 years in prison when she is sentenced next month .
