 Mark Doggett has trained his two animals to sniff out the destructive fungus in old houses where it can hide in places .
Mr Doggetget gave up a ten-year career in construction after the idea to set up a business using the animals ' sense of smell .
When they find dry rot they stop , stare at it and point with their nose .
