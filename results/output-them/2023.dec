 Fiona Cullum , 25 , provided a safe haven for Hassan Hussain and Yassin James after they gunned down innocent nursery teacher Sabrina Moss .
Cullum then lied to officers when quizzed about Hussain after he was arrested in 2013 over the murder in Kilburn , north London .
The men sprayed bullets at mother-of-one Miss Moss and her friends as they took cover from the rain .
But Cullum was jailed for a total of 111 years after they were convicted of murder and attempted murder .
