Welcome to the exoplanet HD 189733b , where temperatures reach 3,000 ° c -LRB- 5,400 °b .
This world might be 63 light-years away - and we ca n't even get a direct image of it - but scientists have been able to measure its atmosphere , just by measuring its sodium emission .
The findings - made with a relatively small telescope - suggest we may soon have the opportunity to examine other distant worlds beyond the solar system in unprecedented detail .
The research were made using a novel technique relying on sodium signals .
