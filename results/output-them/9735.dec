 The 19th century Castle Toward , near Dunoon , was used to ready soldiers for landing at a beach and was commissioned as HMS Brontosaurus in 1942 .
Overlooking the Clyde estuary and easy access to the sloping shoreline , the castle was deemed an ideal training ground for thousands of British troops .
The training was so realistic and demanding that many servicemen were killed in exercises .
