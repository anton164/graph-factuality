 Scott Shirley , his wife Mayo and seven-year-old son Phoenix , were travelling back to Washington DC after a birthday trip to Disney World , Orlando , when they discovered the vomit and complained to cabin crew .
After boarding the plane , the Shirleys were storing their bags under their seats when they noticed their luggage was wet .
United says the family were told by a passenger on an earlier flight had been sick in the seating area .
