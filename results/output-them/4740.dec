Exeter has been dubbed ` too posh for Monopoly ' after game makers were told there is nowhere low-rent enough to fill the space of Old Kent Road .
Thousands of voters have suggested which streets should fill the brown sections of the board , which cost $ 60 in Monopoly money .
But Exeter City Council says there were no suggestions for the lower end .
