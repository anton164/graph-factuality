The Apple Watch is officially going on sale today - none of its stores will have them in stock .
Instead consumers willing to shell out between £ 299 to £ 13,500 have to pre-order the watches online and wait for their arrival until June .
But Apple is sitting on two million pre-orders and that sales could top 20 million this year .
