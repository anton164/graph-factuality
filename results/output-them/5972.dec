A charity set up by Brad Pitt to build new houses for people made homeless when Hurricane Katrina ravaged New Orleans a decade ago is embroiled in legal action .
Pitt , 51 , vowed to help ` make it right for the city 's thousands of displaced citizens by building eco-friendly homes to replace the ones destroyed .
