Incumbent Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel celebrated Tuesday night a hard-fought victory against challenger Jesus ` Chuy ' Garcia .
Emanuel , a former White House chief of staff notorious for his brusque management style , was forced to campaign furiously across the city to beat Cook County Commissioner Garcia after failing to capture a majority against four other candidates .
The mayoral runoff was the first since the city changed the way it conducts elections .
Emanuel had 56 per cent of the vote compared to his opponent .
