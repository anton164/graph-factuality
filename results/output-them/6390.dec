 Office furniture company Steelcase designed the Brody WorkLounge is an effort to preserve the privacy and less distractions given in a cubicle while still being a part of an open office work community .
The seating will be available for purchase in late August starting at $ 2,700 .
The Brody is based on The Cognitive Neuroscience Karolinska Institute in Sweden 's work on flow - a passing state of deep concentration .
