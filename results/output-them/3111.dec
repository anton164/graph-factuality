 Anthony Corrales claims he was driving with his wife and daughter , 10 , last June near Resorts World Casino in the Queens section of New York City when a car cut in front of him after refusing to change lanes .
He claims that when he got out of the car to get the car 's license plate number , he was mowed down by the car , and driven for several blocks by the driver - a retired police officer with the New York Police Department named Robert Muller .
Muller says he was almost killed by a retired NYPD officer who was let off the hook .
