Danny Alexander has finally replied to the infamous note left in the Treasury by his Labour predecessor , saying there was ` no money ' left .
Liam Byrne , who was Chief Secretary to the Treasury under Gordon Brown , left a memo on his desk after Labour 's election defeat in 2010 .
The memo said : ` Dear Chief Secretary said ` there is no money .
Mr Alexander , today sent a letter to Mr Byrne apologising for the late reply .
