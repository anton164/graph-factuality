West Ham striker Carlton Cole says he ca n't approach Sam Allardyce about a new contract - because the manager does n't know whether he 's staying at Upton Park .
Cole 's contract expires at the end of the season and it is unclear whether he will be offered a new deal .
Like Cole , the contract expires in the summer and he is likely he 'll leave West Ham .
