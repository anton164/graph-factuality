 John Helinski , 62 , spent three years living in a cardboard box on the streets of Tampa Bay .
He then tried to apply for a place at a homeless shelter , but struggled because all of his personal identification had been stolen .
A cop and a case manager then looked into his past and were able to retrieve his social security number and his driver 's licence .
Helinski is born in Poland and discovered an old , forgotten account with enough social security benefits in it .
