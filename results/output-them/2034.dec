 a study that found that large amounts of ice were not just at the Martian poles , but likely towards the equator as well .
It means that , if all ice were to be spread across the surface of Mars , the entire planet would be covered in more than 3.3 ft -LRB- .
Mars is currently in the middle of an ice age , so liquid water can not exist on its surface .
