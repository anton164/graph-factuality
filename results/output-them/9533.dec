 The 26-year-old , who was known as ` Chris ' by UK soldiers , was hit in the leg when gunmen opened fire near his home in Khost , eastern Afghanistan .
His son Muhammad also sustained injuries in the attack , which Chris says was the latest in a series of attempts to kill or kidnap him .
Chris says he was forced to stop working for the soldiers because of threats to his family .
