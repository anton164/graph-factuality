 Amy Hughes , 26 , decided to take on the challenge of running 53 marathons in 53 days last year , to raise money for a friend 's daughter who was diagnosed with a brain tumour .
The sports therapist started her first marathon in Chester on August 6 and completed her 53rd consecutive run in Manchester on September 27 .
But the athlete also ran into a new relationship after she got close to long-term friend Dave Keighley - who was part of her support crew .
