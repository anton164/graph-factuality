 The Mark 1 version of Reginald Mitchell 's famous design was among the first built in March 1940 but Spitfire P9374 , once flown by an airman involved in the Great Escape , never made it to the Battle of Britain as it crash-landed in May 1940 .
The fighter plane was being piloted by Flying Officer Peter Cazenove over Dunkirk when it was hit by a bullet from a German Dornier bomber .
