A mother of a baby boy was found wrapped in a blanket inside a Sainsbury 's bag floating on a village pond .
Police exhumed the boy 's body in Norfolk last year after the case came up for review .
A DNA sample led them to his mother .
The woman was arrested on suspicion of infanticide but the charge was dropped after she explained the baby had been stillborn and that she had concealed the pregnancy from her family and friends .
