Former sports minister Gerry Sutcliffe says new allegations surrounding the Bradford City fire in 1985 which claimed 56 lives do not justify a new inquiry into the disaster .
A new book claims the fire at Valley Parade was just one of at least nine fires at businesses owned by the club 's then chairman Stafford Heginbotham , who died in 1995 .
Sutcliffe remains convinced by the conclusion of the inquiry by a spectator dropping a cigarette into the club .
