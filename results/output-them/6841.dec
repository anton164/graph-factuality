The psychedelic cartoon , which is hand-painted , depicts the eponymous submarine from the 1968 film in which the Fab Four travel to Pepperland to save it from the Blue Meanies .
The rare celluloid painting was used as a master version from which artists working on the film created all other images of the vessel .
The original cel is set to sell for Â£ 10,000 when it is sold at auction in Dallas , Texas on Thursday .
