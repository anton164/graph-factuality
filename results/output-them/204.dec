Today marks 81 years since the notorious ` Surgeon 's Photograph ' , claimed to show evidence of a monster living in Loch Ness , was published in the Daily Mail .
And to celebrate , Google has launched its latest Street View experience that lets you virtually explore both above and beneath the water in the iconic Scottish waterway .
The tech giant has also released a Google Doodle to commemorate the anniversary and changed the yellow Pegman to a Nessie peg-monster .
