Dundee boss Paul Hartley has warned that Paul McGowan may not feature in any of the team 's remaining six games this season because he fears playing the troubled midfielder could see him break his police curfew and end up in prison .
After his third conviction for assaulting a police officer , McGowan escaped a jail sentence but was placed to his home from 7 pm to 7 am for 16 weeks .
