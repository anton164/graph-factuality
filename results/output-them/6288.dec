 Duli Hembrom wrote to the principal of Milan Mithi Uchha Vidyalaya after failing to convince her parents to call off the wedding , which is due to take place in two days .
She wrote : ` I do not want to get married , I took an oath at the time of admission before I turn 18 .
She added the ` oath ' Duli refers to is the school 's promise she had to make when she started .
