 Asian elephant never forgets based on a touching video showing an Asian elephant returning to her mother after years apart .
After a 62-mile -LRB- 100 km -RRB- trek through the Thai jungle , Me-Bai , the small elephant can be seen nuzzling her mother , Mae Yui , for three years .
The elephant was sold to provide rides for tourists in Thailand when she was three-and-a-half years old , and did n't see her mother for the trade .
