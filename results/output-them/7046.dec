Supermarket giant Coles has been ordered to pay $ 2.5 million in penalties after lying to shoppers about the freshness of its bread .
In June , It was slammed with a three-year ban to no longer promote its bread as baked on the day it is sold or made from fresh dough .
The falsified fresh bread has generated a revenue of about $ 300 million for Coles .
