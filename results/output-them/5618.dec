Chelsea defender Gary Cahill has backed captain John Terry to shrug off a hostile reception when they head to QPR on Sunday .
It was on the same ground in 2011 that Terry was caught up in a race controversy with ex-QPR defender Anton Ferdinand , banned for four matches and fined Â£ 220,000 by the Football Association for ` using abusive language related to colour .
Terry was cleared in court of racially abusing Ferdinand but was banned and fined by the FA .
