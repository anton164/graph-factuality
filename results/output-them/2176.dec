 Footage shows best friends Carmarie and Kanya sat buckled into the device at the Indy Speedway park on Panama City Beach , Florida , .
At the start they seem pretty calm but when the carriage tilts back and fires 300ft-high panic sets in and they let out manic screams with horrified facial expressions to match .
Both appear to pass out several times due to the extreme force .
