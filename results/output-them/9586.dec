 Tegan Peters , 22 , from Auckland New Zealand said she immediately wanted to warn her Pakuranga community after finding a tennis ball deliberately covered in sharp pins in Ti Rakau , south of Auckland .
Ms Peters said she noticed the ball as she was driving past and decided to pull over , thinking it could be a good present for her one-year-old Rottweiler-cross , Odin .
She was surprised to find a ball that she thinks was purpose designed to harm animals or children .
