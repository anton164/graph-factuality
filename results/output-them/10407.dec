 Riley Filmer , 14 , turned up for classes wearing new shoes on the first day of term at McClelland College , in Melbourne 's south-east , only to be told that the black soft-leather lace-ups did not meet uniform standards .
The Year Eight student was prevented from attending her classes for the day , her mother Anne Parker says excluded her daughter .
The secondary school 's policy states that girls are to wear ` black leather lace-up school shoes ' for both .
