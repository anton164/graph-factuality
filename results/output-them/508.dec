 The unidentified woman from Greenpoint , Brooklyn , was apparently distraught over her troubled marriage .
She walked to the Kosciuszko Bridge from the Brooklyn side shortly before noon on Monday , climbed over a railing and stood on a section of metal piping barely wide enough to fit her feet .
At about 2 pm the woman agreed to be rescued and the woman was taken by ambulance to safety over the railing .
