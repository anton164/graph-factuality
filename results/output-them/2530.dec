Lawyers for a high school honor student in Massachusetts say the teen is ` bewildered ' over the involuntary manslaughter charges against her following the suicide of her friend , according to they push to have the case moved to a different county due to a conflict of interest .
Carter , 18 , looked glum as she appeared in court in New Bedford on Thursday accused of encouraging the death of Conrad Roy III , who gassed himself in his truck in Fairhaven last July .
During her defense attorney requested the case be moved out of Bristol County , saying it 's ` impossible ' for Carter to receive a fair trial in the case .
