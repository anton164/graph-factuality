 Lucy Gransbury , wrote a two-page rant claiming her neighbours were keeping her awake at night .
Grans thought claiming only the deaf and ` those buried in the cemetery ' would have concerns with the noise .
But she followed up by dropping a thank-you card and gifts over the fence to the seven or eight men .
But after a month of not hearing back from neighbours to she was ` too scared ' to knock on their door .
