 More than 700 Asiatic black bears , over a third of those held in captivity in Vietnam , have allegedly been butchered in the past year alone -- with up to four bears inexplicably killed in one day on some farms .
Farmers claim the extinction-threatened bears are dying from disease and old age and owners .
The Vietnamese government faces a race against time to get them to a sanctuary in Tam Dao national park .
