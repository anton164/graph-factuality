 Jasmine Midgley was born with a birthmark , her parents were assured it was cutting off her air supply .
At just 10 weeks old , she was rushed back to hospital because the seemingly harmless mark had started growing into her throat , almost closing over her airways and choking her .
Doctors diagnosed a rare condition called a subglottioma - a benign tumour made up of blood vessels .
