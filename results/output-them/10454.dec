The London Borough of Barking and Dagenham wants dog owners to submit a DNA sample from the inside of the animal 's cheek so it is registered on a database .
The council would then use stored information to match the animal responsible with any errant mess found on the streets - and issue the owner an Â£ 80 fine .
The laboratory testing is believed to be 99.9 per cent accurate .
