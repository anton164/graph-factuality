 Daisy Bentley , the 23-year-old artist has scoured the streets of cities and towns looking for those bits of paper that flutter to the ground .
Her quest has uncovered a collection of shopping lists , reminders , love notes and motivational musings .
Bentley began collecting them six years ago after a note caught her eye .
She says her collecting has led to the human condition .
