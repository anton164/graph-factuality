Raheem Sterling arrived at Liverpool 's Melwood base for training on Wednesday .
Sterling has escaped a club punishment after being caught on video inhaling the legal high nitrous oxide , but fresh pictures have emerged of him holding a shisha pipe , alongside young team-mate Jordon Ibe .
Sterling , 20 , and Ibe , 19 , were pictured during what is believed to be a visit to a cafe in London .
