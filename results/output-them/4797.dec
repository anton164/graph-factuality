 Zara Tindall , 33 , has pretended to pull her 16st 6ft rugby player husband Mike along while striking a pose for the cameras .
The moment came during a charity event to mark the end of personal trainer Rob Edmond 's marathon barrel-roll from Perthshire to Wiltshire .
Edmond , who set off nine days and 517 miles ago , rolled the whisky barrel for 12 hours a day .
