 Janet and John Brennan have spent eight years and hundreds of thousands of pounds turning Barholm Castle , in Dumfries and Galloway , from a ruin into a stylish castle home .
They bought the 15th Century fort , reputed to have been used by leader of the Scottish Protestant Reformation John Knox as a hiding place , for just Â£ 65,000 .
Janet , 60 , and John , 64 , insist the project was a ` labour of love ' and ` no regrets .
