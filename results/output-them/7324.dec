 A mix-up at New Cross Hospital in Wolverhampton meant staff confused the notes of three patients .
As a result , Elizabeth Dawes was wrongly told in July 2013 that she had invasive grade three breast cancer .
But four days after the operation she was told staff had confused her medical notes with other patients and she 'd never had cancer .
The mother-of-one was told she would need major surgery to remove a ` cancerous ' tumour from her right breast .
