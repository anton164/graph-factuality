The birth of Alanna and Stephan Goetzinger 's third daughter Rana died either during birth or within minutes afterwards .
A coroner found that the care given by the midwife who assisted at the birth was ` grossly inadequate and may have contributed to the death of the baby .
But the couple refuses to blame midwife and have spoken out against the coroner 's report which blames their midwife .
Rana had died either ` during or shortly after birth ' .
