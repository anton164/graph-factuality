After searching far and wide for two years , the 36-year-old amazingly found the medals in the Northern Territory and drove over 3500 kilometres in four days to be reunited with the family treasures .
But on his arrival at the Darwin Military Museum , Mr Cordina was refused the medals and told that they ` were more important to the museum .
Medals include an Airforce Cross , War Medal , a Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal and others .
