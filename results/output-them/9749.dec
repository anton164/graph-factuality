Methane , the principle component in natural gas , is created by chemical reactions in the crust beneath the seafloor .
Now scientists have found vast deep water gas hydrates in the Arctic that are reservoirs for abiotic methane -- a gas which is 20 times more effective in trapping heat than carbon dioxide .
The gas forms through a process called serpentinisation .
Methane is the second-largest greenhouse gas contributor to climate change .
