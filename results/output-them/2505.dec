Suspected rogue trader Navinder Sarao lived in his parents ' modest home because it gave him a split-second advantage worth millions of pounds - and a Â£ 40million offshore nest egg .
His family 's semi-detached house in suburban West London is closer to an internet server used by one of the major exchanges , giving him a nanosecond advantage over rivals in the City .
His thousands of high-frequency trades could be processed faster than those from dealers in Central London .
He was arrested on Tuesday at home with his parents , accused him of helping to trigger the Wall Street ` Flash Crash ' of 2010 .
