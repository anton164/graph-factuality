 96-year-old Robert Clark is a council refused to increase funding he needs for a live-in carer .
It means the Second World War veteran could be forced out of his home of nearly 50 years and into a care home -- a move his son describes as ` like going back into a prisoner of war camp .
But the council insists he can not be treated as a special case .
Mr Clark is registered blind , deaf in one ear and is dependent on a wheelchair .
