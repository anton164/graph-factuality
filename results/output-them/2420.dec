 Traffic had started to build up on the M58 around Switch Island on Merseyside .
But one driver in a silver Mercedes obviously was n't prepared to wait in the queuing traffic on the outside lane .
But a Renault driver pulled into the inside lane to block the Mercedes from moving forwards .
The Mercedes is forced to wait 10 minutes in the lane .
