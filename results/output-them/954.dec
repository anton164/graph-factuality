 Mahendra Ahirwar , 12 , from Madhya Pradesh in central India , suffers from a rare condition that makes his neck bend and his head hang from his body .
His weak backbone means he ca n't stand or walk and needs help to eat and go to the toilet .
His father Mukesh , 40 , says they have consulted more than 50 doctors across India but none could diagnose his condition .
