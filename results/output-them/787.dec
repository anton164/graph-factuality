 Kerrie Armitage , from Leeds , suffers from the ultra-rare condition aquagenic urticaria -- an allergy to water .
She was diagnosed two years ago after her skin erupted in agonising blisters when she got caught in a rain storm .
Now the 28-year-old has had to stop kissing her husband of four years , because the saliva on his lips can trigger a painful flare-up .
