 The Italian-inspired mansion , which has incredible 360-degree views across the mountains , has now gone on the market for a tidy $ 29.5 million .
Homeowner Dick Rothkopf , chose the location for the estate in 2008 because his family enjoyed hiking in the hills .
But the property is so remote that it took two years , a team of engineers and $ 1 million to build the 1.5-mile driveway .
