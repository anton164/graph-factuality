A 12-year-old schoolboy needed to be rescued after falling down an eight-foot drain which had been left uncovered .
Firefighters worked with police and ambulance staff to free the boy , a pupil at Stanground Academy , whose leg was trapped for more than half an hour down the hole .
It is believed the rubber drain cover had been kicked out of position in Peterborough , Cambridgeshire on Monday afternoon .
