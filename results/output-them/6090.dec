Police are believed to have identified one of the men behind the jewel heist in Hatton Garden , as it was revealed the gang could have been inspired by similar robberies in Los Angeles in the 1980s .
Officers from Scotland Yard 's Flying Squad released images of three suspects on Saturday , but refused to release a picture of the supposed ringleader .
The novel was based on real-life bank robbers dubbed ` The Hole In The Ground Gang , and were never caught .
