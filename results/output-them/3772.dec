 Nasa has captured ` ribbons ' of sand and patterned stripes known as linear dunes in the Erg Chech , a desolate sand sea in southwestern Algeria - but the exact cause of these longitudinal structures is not known .
Linear dunes , like these captured by Nasa 's Landsat 7 satellite , are straight ridges of sand that have been known to measure as long as 99 miles -LRB- .
This image was caused as rays of sunlight hit the sand .
