 Detectives are investigating the killing of David King , a 70-year-old pensioner from Newham , east London , retired to Normandy .
His body was found by sniffer dogs last week in the picturesque hamlet of Pierres , south-west of Caen , and an unnamed 28-year charged Frenchman has been charged with his murder .
Mr King may well have confronted the man over stolen vegetables .
