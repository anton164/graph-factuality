The Apple Watch is officially going on sale , none of its stores will have them in stock .
Instead consumers willing to shell out between $ 549 to $ 17,000 - for the gold edition - have to pre-order the watches online and wait for their arrival until June .
But analysts believe Apple is sitting on two million pre-orders and that sales could top 20 million this year .
