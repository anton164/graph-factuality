 The CH-53E Super Stallion landed on the shore of this northern San Diego County town shortly after 11:30 am after a low oil-pressure indicator light went on in the cockpit .
The 100-foot copter is twice the size of the humpback whales that sometimes wash up on surrounding shores .
No one was injured in the landing .
