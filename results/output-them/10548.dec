 Kay Bennett , 33 , from Swindon says the tattoos , which were done when she was 24 , have turned her into a jobless recluse .
Until they are removed , I wo n't be able to find a job and will be stuck on benefits .
Miss Bennett , resigned from her last role because she felt ` left out ' by colleagues , and is now hoping someone will step forward and offer to pay for her laser removal .
She says she has applied for 40 jobs in the last year but without success .
