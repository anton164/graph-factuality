 Lexy Wood , the 13-year-old daughter of Kyesha Smith Wood , told Rebecca Boyd that she is 'em barrassed ' by the way she acted when she disrupted a screening of Cinderella in Bessemer , Alabama .
She and her brother Nick , 16 , were said to have been ` rude and obnoxious ' throughout the film .
She said her husband had just been laid off and the teenagers had ruined the last time she would be taking her daughter to the movies .
Mrs Wood , 36 , was mortified when she heard about the encounter .
