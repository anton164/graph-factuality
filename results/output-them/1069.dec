 Jane Bacon , 51 , from East Grinstead , West Sussex , booked the ` final trip ' to Sharm El Sheikh with her husband Peter , 52 , after being told she could die from breast cancer .
However she bought the £ 1,000-trip before doctors told her she needed an 18-week course of chemotherapy .
She has now hit out at easyJet after she received an email asking her to pay £ 176 to switch her flights .
