 three Australian models whose video of themselves miming along to Queen 's Bohemian Rhapsody went viral have travelled to the US .
Their original video , ` Be on Ellen ' was on her diary list of ' 100 things I want to do before I die ' ' .
Shae-Lee Shackleford , 28 Kington , 25 , Madison Lloyd , 27 , are quickly capitalising on The Ellen show and Good Morning America .
The girls were appearing to The Ellen De Generes on Wednesday .
