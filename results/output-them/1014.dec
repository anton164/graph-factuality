Retired news legend Barbara Walters says that the former White House intern would be a ` run away success ' on The View , a network source .
She would attract great guests - casting her as a regular co-host would make it unlikely that potential 2016 Presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton or President Bill Clinton would appear on the show again .
The multi-host show was created by Walters in 1997 .
