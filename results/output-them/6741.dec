 The child was on holiday in Burnham-on-Sea with his family from Manchester when he walked across the mudflats on Wednesday .
Seemingly unaware of the low tide , he quickly became stuck and had to be pulled to safety by the coastguard in its hovercraft .
He was unhurt in the incident , and was seen leaving the beach .
