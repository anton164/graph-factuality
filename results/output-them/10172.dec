 The experts were able to take control of a so-called telerobot during surgery by exploiting a simple programming trick .
This enabled them to change the speed of the robot and change their orientation , making it impossible for the machines to carry out a procedure as directed .
This they are operated over public networks which allowed the researchers to stop them working .
The research is .
