David Cameron has admitted he will have failed as Tory leader if he does not win a majority at the next election .
The Prime Minister said voters were not ` fully sure ' about the Tories at the last election , but claimed they would back the party .
He said he only needed 23 seats to win a win , ` If I fall short of those 23 seats I will feel I have not succeeded .
Mr Cameron says nothing made him ` more angry than the Tories being called the party of the rich .
