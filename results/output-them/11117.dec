 Kyle Seitz , 37 , of Ridgefield , received two years of conditional release at the hearing in Danbury Superior Court after his lawyer read aloud a letter written by his wife asking the judge for leniency .
Authorities say Seitz forgot to take his 15-month-old son , Benjamin , to day care and left him in the car for seven hours .
Temperatures that day soared into the upper 80s .
