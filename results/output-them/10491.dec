Sunderland have been branded ` disgraceful ' following their shock decision not to suspend Adam Johnson despite the player facing child sex charges .
The 27-year-old has been charged with three offences of sexual activity with a 15-year girl and one of grooming and could face a prison term of up to 14 years if found guilty .
But Sunderland announced Johnson will remain available for selection and he is set to feature at Stoke .
