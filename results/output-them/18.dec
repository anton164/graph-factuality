 Kuku Kube has been designed to put your colour vision and eyesight to the test by showing boards of coloured squares .
On each board , one of the squares is a slightly different shade of the same colour and the aim is to find this odd square by tapping it with your finger .
Scores lower than 11 are poor , scores between 15 and 20 is ` lower than average ' , and a score higher than 31 means your eyesight is considered great .
