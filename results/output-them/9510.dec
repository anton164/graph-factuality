 47-year-old man from Warwick , 150 km south-west of Brisbane , has been accused of sexually abusing 28 children from three states , including taking some of his victims to hotel rooms where he allegedly raped them .
Police allege the man used a range of social media sites to prey on children under the age of 16 and arranged meetings so he could physically abuse them .
So far 28 victims have been identified from Queensland , NSW and Victoria , but police believe there may be others as far away as Western Australia .
