The U.S. Senate voted on Thursday to approve Loretta Lynch as President Barack Obama 's next attorney general , ending a five-month deadlock that made Lynch wait longer for confirmation than the last seven attorneys general combined .
The first black woman to become the top U. S. law enforcement official , Lynch was approved by a 56-43 vote .
She is expected to take over as head of the Justice Department on Monday , replacing Eric Holder .
