 Little Stella Schaefer is being cared for in prison by Mack , 19 , who allegedly murdered her socialite mother Sheila Von Wiese-Mack in a plush Bali hotel last August before stuffing her body in a suitcase , together with her boyfriend Tommy Schaefer , 21 .
While Stella was being looked after by a friend outside the court , a blanket fell away , revealing the child 's face for the first time .
Lawyers for both Americans say they rejected the premeditated charges .
