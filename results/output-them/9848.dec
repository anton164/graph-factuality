 Louis Jordan , 37 , who was rescued 200 miles off the North Carolina coast , said he survived for more than two months on his stricken boat by eating fish he caught by trailing dirty clothes in the ocean , and by catching rainwater in a bucket .
But doubters have questioned Jordan -- who declined medical help despite claiming to have broken a shoulder and he appears well-fed with unblemished skin .
Jordan says he lost 50 lbs after he was in missing .
