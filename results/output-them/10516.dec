 Fossicker Ashley Manzie was combing the park with his metal detector when he discovered a medal belonging to Frederick George Biddulph , who served with the 23rd Australian Infantry Battalion at Gallipolli between 1914 and 1915 .
Mr Manzie posted photos of the silver medal to an online fossicking forum .
He thinks the medal does n't belong to Frederick , but to his brother .
