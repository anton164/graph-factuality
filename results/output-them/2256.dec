 The monuments of Kathmandu , the capital of Nepal , are recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage site because of their unique architecture .
But several of the most recognisable buildings in the city , including towers and temples , now lie in rubble after a 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit the country .
The now-destroyed tower was the Dharahara Tower , the Bhimsen Tower , which has almost totally collapsed after the quake .
