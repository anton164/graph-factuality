 David Curry , 49 , had travelled ten miles from home to visit The Wallow in Blyth , Northumberland , for the first time .
But when the family arrived Mr Curry was told he could not stay in the pub because he was wearing a pair of Â£ 40 Adidas trousers .
The pub chain has apologised to Mr Curry , said a no-tracksuit policy had been in the bar since 2013 .
