 Carwyn Scott-Howell got lost on the slopes and left the piste before walking through a treacherously steep wooded area .
The Welsh schoolboy was holidaying in the French resort of Flaine with his mother Ceri , elder brother Gerwyn , 19 , and nine-year-old sister Antonia when the accident took place .
Police believe the boy was killed instantly in the fall after leaving the ski slope to look for his family .
