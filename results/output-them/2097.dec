Pet aquarium fish are being caught weighing up to 2 kg and koi carp up to 8 kg and one metre in length , in the waterways of Western Australia amongst introduced species .
A lot of these fish are much larger than the native fish , so they prey on them and compete for habitat .
The introduced species are also bringing exotic parasites and disease with them .
