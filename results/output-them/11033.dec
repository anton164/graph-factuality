 Kyle Toth , built the seesaw from trees behind his workshop in Temecula .
It measures a whopping 45ft in length , sends its occupiers into the air at a height of around 25ft .
Kyle said the tree was about 65ft long so he cut it to make it even on both sides and the sees .
Kyle climbed the tree with a sledge hammer to stop it from sliding .
