One of the closest friends of Georgina Bartter , who died after consuming an ecstasy pill at a music festival last year , has pleaded guilty to supplying the teenager with the fatal pills that led to her death .
Ms Hannibal had pleaded not guilty to single supply charge but her defence representative .
Police alleged Ms Hannibal , of Cammeray , supplied a number of ` purple speaker ' pills between 2 pm and 3:30 pm on November 7 .
Police charge sheets allege the pills were purchased from Matthew Forti , 19 , and Ms Bartter died from multiple organ failure .
