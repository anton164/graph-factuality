 in Hallett Cove , South Australia , when a man smacked a huge wolf spider as it scuttled across his kitchen floor .
He squashed the hairy beast with a broom , only to see hundreds of baby spiders came crawling out of the mother and on the floor .
But after smashing the female spider a few times with the broom hundreds of babies appear .
