A experiment to help dementia patients by waking them up with video recordings from loved ones is taking place in New York .
The idea is borrowed from the 2004 Adam Sandler film 50 First Dates , in which Drew Barrymore 's character suffers a brain injury and memory loss .
A suitor , played by Sandler , uses videos to remind her of him .
The Hebrew Home is in dementia .
