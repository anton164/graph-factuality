The prison guard who allegedly had an affair with the man convicted of killing one-punch victim Thomas King has been identified as a 30-year-old ironwoman competitor .
It was revealed last month Kieran Loveridge , who brutally attacked Mr Kelly at Kings Cross , was moved to Goulburn Supermax prison because he had an ` improper relationship ' with a female officer .
The 21-old-old is thought to have had a relationship with Port Macquarie woman Jody Marsidge .
Ms Marson was suspended after other staff members claimed they had witness the alleged affair .
