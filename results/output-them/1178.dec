Small businesses and restaurants will be forced to close over the Easter long weekend as they struggle to cover the costs of penalty rates on public holidays .
Many operators across the country will face penalty rates of up to two-and-a-half times regular pay that would allow young workers to earn around $ 50 an hour as a casual .
But the Australian Chamber of Commerce has launched a campaign in a bid for small businesses to call changes to the penalty rates .
