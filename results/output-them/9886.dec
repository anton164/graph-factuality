 a police poster advising women to stick together on a night out provoked anger .
Sussex Police was accused of ` victim-blaming ' in its campaign , which urges women not to leave their friends alone or let them wander off with strangers .
Women 's rights groups said rapists were to blame for sex attacks , not their victims .
But the poster won praise from supporters arguing it implies that victims are to blame .
