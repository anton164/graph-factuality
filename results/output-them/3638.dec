Czech immigrants were trafficked into the UK by a Roma family on the promise of a ` better life ' were forced to work for free and sleep in cupboards .
The victims were lured to Britain but were made to urinate in buckets and live and eat outside in winter .
The jury heard the workers were kept under duress amid fears for the safety of their families back home and sent to work in dog food factories , food plants and car washes in Plymouth .
Police say the men were threatened with violence by the gang .
