Help for Heroes has launched a fundraising drive to keep World War II veteran Robert Clark in his own home after a London council refused to pay for a live-in carer to stay with the 96-year-old former prisoner of war .
Now the council want to move Mr Clark from the house he has lived in for 50 years into a care home because they claim it is cheaper .
They have so far raised £ 2,736.22 of the £ 5,000 needed .
