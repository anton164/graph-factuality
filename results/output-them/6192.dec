 Capturing the footage in Santa Barbara , California , Scott Kaiser filmed the back of the large pelican sitting on a post overlooking the water .
Recording the bird in slow motion , it began lifting its head all the way back and opening its mouth extremely wide to show off the size difference between the beak .
The bird lifts its head right back and opens its air sacs to expose its tongue and some inner bill .
