The FBI have recovered one of the gold bars stolen in a $ 5 million armored truck robbery in North Carolina last month .
Investigators say the location the bar was found - somewhere in South Florida - has provided them with a big break in the case .
Police have said they suspected it was an inside job because the 18-wheeler truck pulled over on March 1 in Wilson County .
