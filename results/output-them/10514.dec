A lawsuit filed by former Gossip Girl actress Kelly Rutherford attempting to have a judge order her kids to return to the U.S. from their father 's custody in France .
The case was dismissed with a court order stating it did not have the jurisdiction to force the kids , son Hermes , 8 , and daughter Helena , 5 , to come back to the United States .
Rutherford , 46 , claims her children were illegally deported to her ex-husband Daniel Giersch , 40 , and she pleaded for the order to be reversed .
She says Rutherford failed to argue why the federal court should intervene in her custody dispute .
