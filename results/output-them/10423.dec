A driver , who is named Ashley X after changing his surname by deed poll , was caught on camera driving his Honda sports car at 67mph on a 50mph section of the M11 in Essex in 2009 .
Instead of coughing up a fixed penalty fine , he ignored Essex Police 's attempts to confirm who was driving the car before making up a series of stories to shift the blame .
X tried to fight the speeding charge in six different courts .
