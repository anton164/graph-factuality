 Landlord Richard Stevenson , 32 , had mascot Ollie the Owl snatched from the lounge area of the Admiral Rodney , in Nottingham , last month .
He thought the Â£ 7.99 ornament had been lost forever until he received a letter in the post on March 6 demanding a donation to charity for its return .
The wooden statue has already jetted off to Belfast , Benidorm and Tunisia despite only going missing a month ago .
