 A mysterious young soldier known as the ` Handsome Man ' after his image was used to front Woolworths ' ` Fresh in our memories ' ad campaign , which has been slammed for commercialising the centenary of Anzac and forcibly shut down by the government .
He was a soldier of the First Australian Imperial Force , and his photograph was taken sometime between 1915 and 1918 in Sydney .
The campaign invites Aussies to create a profile picture and cover photo for their Facebook page , in memory of World War I .
