 Ed Balls has warned the idea of scrapping non-dom rules would cost the country money .
The Labour leader used a speech to say he will ` abolish ' the 200-year-old rule for non-doms , which applies to around 116,000 people , claiming they make Britain an ` offshore tax haven for a few ' and can ` no longer be justified .
But Miliband argues that non- working tests ` are not very rigorous and can be granted to people who have a property abroad .
