 Karen Gaynor appeared at Rotherham Magistrates Court accused of causing criminal damage by pruning the tree , after a complaint was made by her neighbour Kay Daye as part of a long-running boundary dispute .
But magistrates took just 15 minutes to find the 53-year-old not guilty , saying she had acted with good intentions .
The council officials had told Ms Gaynor that she could trim the tree ` went way beyond the lawful excuse and caused ` unnecessary damage .
