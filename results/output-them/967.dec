Police have released surveillance images of a man who robbed a bank dressed in women 's clothing - leading investigators to compare his outfit with Mrs Doubtfire .
The eccentrically-disguised man entered a branch of the U.S Bank in the city of Santa Cruz at around 3 pm last Friday and handed the cashier a note demanding money .
His blonde wig , female clothing , glasses and purse immediately prompted comparisons with Robin Williams played a divorcee who dresses as an elderly female nanny .
