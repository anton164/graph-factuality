Gary Teale has hit back at Celtic boss Ronny Deila 's criticism of the St Mirren Park pitch .
After the Parkhead club 's 2-0 win on Friday night , Deila branded most surfaces in the Scottish Premiership ` terrible ' and artificial pitches would make better spectacles .
Teale insists the Norwegian 's award was unjustified and unfair on the Paisley club , Tommy Docherty .
