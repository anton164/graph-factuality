 Rebecca Exton-Russell , 37 , was formally a size 18 and posed in campaigns for major brands including Marks & Spencer , QVC and Dove .
But the Derby-based model was secretly ` repulsed by her body , so she checked into a military-style fitness camp and lost from 14 stone to 12 stone .
Rebecca lost a further stone herself after she left No 1 Boot Camp in Norfolk - dropping to 11 stone , and slipping into size 12 outfits .
