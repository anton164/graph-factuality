Real Madrid have appealed against the yellow card shown to Cristiano Ronaldo for diving in the penalty area during their 2-0 win over Rayo Vallecano .
Ronaldo appeared to be unfairly cautioned by referee Mario Melero Lopez after he was chopped down by defender Antonio Amaya inside the box .
The decision means Ronaldo is suspended for the game against Eibar in La Liga on Saturday .
