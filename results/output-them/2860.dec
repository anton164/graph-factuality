 six real-life women and their children are gathered to find the answer .
The sweet youngsters are blindfolded and asked to pick their mum out of the group , while their mothers can be seen waiting to see whether their child would recognise them .
The video was created by Pandora to celebrate Mother 's Day and the special bond between mother and child .
