 Lewis Ferguson at Paul Nicholls ' yard on Thursday morning .
The 18-year-old was mucking out the stables as just , just a cut on the nose to show for the fall which has been watched hundreds of thousands of times online .
Ferguson , whose double somersault horror fall from the favourite .
But he was back riding out and he was undeterred from getting back in the sad .
