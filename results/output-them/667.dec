Jeremy Clarkson and his fellow Top Gear presenters were on the brink of a lucrative new contract for three more years but were scrapped when the star punched the show 's producer .
James May , 52 , revealed he had prematurely celebrated the three-year deal by ordering a rare Â£ 200,000 Ferrari before Clarkson 's sacking after an ` fracas ' with producer Oisin Tymon .
May says he had ordered the Ferrari 458 Speciale - in bright orange while the ` draft version ' of the lucrative contract was sitting on his desk .
But Clarkson , 55 , was sacked by the BBC .
