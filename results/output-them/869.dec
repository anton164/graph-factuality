Photographers have captured some remarkable pictures of the Lyrid meteor shower above the UK last night .
The meteor shower , visible around the world has been observed for the past 2,700 years and peaked overnight with between ten and 20 an hour .
And the cosmic show will continue on into Saturday , so it is still possible to catch a glimpse of some meteors .
