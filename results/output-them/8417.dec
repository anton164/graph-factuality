Humpback whale populations are to be declassified as ` endangered ' following a successful conservation programme .
At one stage the worldwide population dropped to just a few thousand due to over-fishing and hunting , but it has now recovered to 90,000 .
However experts have warned it is too soon to declare the conservation project a success .
Ten of these will be ` not at risk ' , two ` threatened ' and two ` endangered .
