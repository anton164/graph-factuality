 Robert Durst say he wants authorities to return more than $ 161,000 in cash taken after the real estate heir was arrested for murder .
The attorneys say Durst , 72 , got the money , now held by New Orleans police legally and it is not needed for evidence .
Durst was arrested at the JW Marriott hotel in New Orleans on a Los Angeles County warrant that accused him of killing his friend Susan Berman in 2000 to keep her from talking to investigators about the disappearance of his first wife in 1982 .
