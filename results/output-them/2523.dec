Reading goalkeeper Adam Federici has taken to Twitter to apologise for his crucial gaffe in Saturday 's FA Cup semi-final defeat to Arsenal .
With the game finishing 1-1 after 90 minutes , the Australian inexplicably let a tame Alexis Sanchez shot slip through his grasp in the sixth minute of extra-time .
The 30-year-old issued an apology to Reading 's fans .
