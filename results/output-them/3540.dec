 a crack team of surgeons from the Australian charity , Interplast , worked last March to save the sight of little baby Seng , from Laos , , burns survivor Turia Pitt , she would n't be here .
Foreign doctors would have been able to save her from the flames that nearly killed her by lashing 64 per cent of her body with burns in 2011 .
Seng 's sight was saved by doctor volunteers from Interplar .
