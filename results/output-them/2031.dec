 E.ON has been forced to pay a Â£ 7.75 million penalty after it ripped off customers who were switching to rivals .
The money will go to Citizens Advice to fund the organisation 's work helping those trying to cut their energy bills .
E.on effectively overcharged thousands who decided to move to other suppliers after it announced price rises in January 2013 and again in early 2014 .
