Attorneys for two sides agree that a 24-year-old man who had been pointed out by a college student as her rapist had his truck rear-ended before he was kidnapped , brutally beaten and killed .
Prosecutors said Van was enraged after his ex-girlfriend Norma Patricia Esparza told him Ramirez had raped her and he must be held responsible for the attack .
The case has drawn international attention since Vanza went on to become a psychology professor and moved to France .
