The head of the Drug Enforcement Administration , Michele Leonhart , is expected to resign soon , an Obama administration official said Tuesday .
Leonhart is a career drug agent who has led the agency since 2007 and is the second woman to hold the job .
She has faced mounting pressure from Congress , where some questioned her competence in the wake of a government watchdog report detailing allegations that agents attended sex parties with prostitutes .
Lawmakers have calling for Leonhart to resign or be fired .
