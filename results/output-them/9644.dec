 Labour party leader Ed Miliband said it was ` not good enough ' for millions of workers not to know how many hours they would be working from one week to the next .
He said a Labour government would give workers the right to demand a ` regular contract if they do regular hours ' after three months .
Mr Miliband says workers should be given the right after 12 weeks to demand ` a regular contract for regular hours .
