Five staff members sustained serious injuries after taking a joy ride down ` the Super Slide ' at the Sydney Royal Easter Show on Saturday night , despite the slide being closed after heavy rain made it too dangerous .
It is understood a group were travelling at such great speeds that they were unable to stop and broke through the barricade at the bottom of the ride .
A 22-year old woman broke both her legs , a 60-year-old man suffered broken ribs and his arm .
