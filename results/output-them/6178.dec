A 77-year-old woman was left partially blind after a lightning bolt struck her as she sat in her car .
Rather , her hairdresser noticed she had suffered minor burns on her scalp .
Later that day the pensioner noticed her eye sight was blurred - she could barely see with her right eye .
A scan of her retina revealed she had a hole in her retina .
