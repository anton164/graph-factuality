 Fossils of a creature bearing a ` striking ' similarity to depictions of Nessie have been found in a 19th century collection .
Originally belonging to Cromarty writer and geologist Hugh Miller , the specimens now sit in Inverness Museum and Art Gallery .
Now researchers have revealed that ` Pessie may have lived at the bottom of the freshwater lakes that would later become Loch Ness .
