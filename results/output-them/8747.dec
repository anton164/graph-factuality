 Dr Michael Shannon saved Chris Trokey 's life when he was born premature more than 30 years ago .
But in 2011 , Dr Shannon was trapped in his burning SUV after it was T-boned by a semi-truck , when Trokey , an Orange County Fire Authority paramedic , worked to pull him out alive .
Their story was shared by KTLA after the pair both participated in a fundraiser for childhood cancer in Rancho Santa Margarita , California .
