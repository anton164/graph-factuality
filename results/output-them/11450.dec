INXS guitarist Kirk Pingelly and his surfing champion wife Layne Beachly won their case against a disgruntled neighbour who wanted to stop the redevelopment of their northern beaches home .
The pair 's three bedroom home was purchased in 2007 for $ 2.6 million and features extensive views of Freshwater and Queenscliff beaches .
The council initially suggested the couple withdraw their plans and reconsider a way they could ` destroy ' her views .
