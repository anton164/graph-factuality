 The Bruno Smartcan is said to be the first internet connected combined kitchen bin and vacuum cleaner .
Using sensors on the front of the bin , it is able to sense when dust and debris from the kitchen floor is swept towards it with a brush , turning on a vacuum to suck up the offending mess .
The The Smartcan uses sensors to detect when you want the lid to open or when dirt has been swept close so it .
Bruno comes with an integrated bag store and charging cord .
