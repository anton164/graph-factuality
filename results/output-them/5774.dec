 Grey and white cat Marv somehow managed to get wedged in a five inch gap in between owner Brendon Veale 's garage and his neighbours in Hanham , Bristol and was left dangling for two hours .
The RSPCA were called and they had to tunnel through a garage wall with a chisel to get him free .
Marv was shaken by his ordeal and was reunited with his owner .
