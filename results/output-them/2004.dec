 Scientist Fergus Simpson has calculated the minimum size needed for intelligent life to survive based on the laws of conservation of energy seen on Earth .
And he calculates that if intelligent extraterrestrials exist they will typically weigh 650 lbs -LRB- 300 kg -RRB- - the median weight of a polar bear .
Mr Simpson came to this conclusion by applying a mathematical formula that assumes aliens obey the same laws of energy as animals .
This means that larger animals need more resources to survive .
