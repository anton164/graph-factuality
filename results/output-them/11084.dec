 Tayler Chaice Buzbee was forced to make an emergency appointment at an Aspen Dental facility in Alabama on Friday morning after developing agonizing toothache which would not go away .
But after calling the dentist 's office , she was informed that the only available appointment was in just 20 minutes - meaning she had no time to find a babysitter for her infant son , Attley .
Tayler was assured by employees that she could bring her baby to the dentist .
The pair turned up shortly through the appointment .
