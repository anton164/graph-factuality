 Former Melbourne woman Dullel Kassab fled to Raqqa in Syria with her children last year , and she regularly boasts on Twitter that her four-year-old daughter and two-year son sleep with toy guns next to their beds and her daughter likes watching IS videos of ` Muslims killing bad ppl .
The children 's paternal grandparents say they are worried Kassab is ` brainwashing ' the children , after their father was killed near the Syria-Turkey border last year .
