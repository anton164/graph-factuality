Daniel Ricciardo has called for a back-to-basics approach for Red Bull to forge a return to the front of the grid . Second best to Mercedes last season after a run of four successive championship triumphs , Red Bull have struggled at the start of this year . To rub salt into the wounds , Red Bull even found themselves trailing ` sister ' team Toro Rosso at the last race in Malaysia . Daniel Ricciardo in action during practice for this weekend 's Chinese Grand Prix . The Australian driver has urged his Red Bull team to go back to basics after a troubled start to 2015 . The main gripe has centred on power-unit supplier Renault , with billionaire benefactor Dietrich Mateschitz suggesting this week he could pull his team out of the sport if matters fail to improve . Ahead of this weekend 's grand prix in China , Ricciardo concedes Red Bull are exploring numerous avenues to correct the problems . The Australian managed to finish third quickest in practice , a second behind reigning champion Lewis Hamilton in his Mercedes and four tenths of a second adrift of Ferrari 's Kimi Raikkonen . 1 .

In Malaysia we had brake issues , a lot of overheating , so we have reverted back on a few things , even from last year which we knew was more efficient . ` Just because it 's from last year it does n't mean it 's not better , so I guess we have taken a step back in that direction . The team has done quite a lot to rectify some issues and get us further up the grid . ' Ricciardo has no doubt Renault are also pulling their weight , adding : ` From Melbourne to Malaysia they made a pretty massive step with driveability . ` We also have a few more software things this weekend , which should give things another pretty significant step on that side . ` I appreciate what everyone is doing to get us back towards the front , so fingers crossed it can be put together in the right way this weekend and if so we can get back into that top five . ' Daniil Kvyat was forced to pull off track 19 minutes from the end of FP2 after his brakes caught fire . Team-mate Daniil Kvyat , however , was not so fortunate as the young Russian was forced to pull off track 19 minutes from the end of FP2 after his brakes caught fire . Christian Horner said : ` Something overheated within the rear hub assembly . As a result of that we lost pressure in the master cylinder halfway round the lap . ` We asked him to drive back slowly without using the brakes if at all possible , but unfortunately he had to brake at turn 14 and he had a very slow off . ` It 's frustrating it 's happened , but all the relevant pieces are intact so we can find out what the root cause was . ' Despite suffering brake issues in Malaysia , Horner insists the issue there and the one experienced by Kvyat are ` totally unrelated ' . Horner added : ` Today was a one-off and can be sorted for tomorrow . '
