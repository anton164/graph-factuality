Gary Neville tore into Manchester City following their defeat against Crystal Palace by insisting the champions have a ` mentality problem ' which prevents them from winning back-to-back titles . The former Manchester United and England defender saw City lose 2-1 to leave them in fourth - nine points short of Chelsea at the top of the Barclays Premier League . ` They 've got a mentality problem . There 's no doubt , ' Neville said on Monday Night Football . ` This team can not sustain success . Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany leaves the field after their 2-1 defeat by Crystal Palace on Monday . Manuel Pellegirni is under pressure as City fell nine points behind Chelsea in the Premier League table . How the top of the Premier League table looks . ` When you win championships , you 've got to be able to come back again and show the same hunger . They do n't . They drop off it . They get to the top of the mountain and go , `` phew , we did it '' , and it 's the worst thing that can happen . ' ` They are falling well short of where they should be . Make no mistake about that . It 's now or never for this team . They ca n't progress beyond the knockout stages or the last 16 of the Champions League . ` They ca n't sustain success by winning back-to-back championships . They 're getting older . Their average age is the highest in the league at 29 and a half . Unfortunately some of those lads not going to be there next season . They 're going to pay for what is a disappointing season , it is looking like now . ` They 're going to get into the top four but that Manchester City team with the ambition that they have got and with the quality they should be doing a lot better .
