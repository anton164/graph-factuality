Chelsea and Manchester City are both willing to pay the Â£ 13 million buyout clause for highly-rated Valencia left-back Jose Luis Gaya . The 19-year-old Spaniard is Real Madrid 's first choice to fill the left side of their defence next season . But AS reports that both Chelsea and City are keen to snap Gaya up , with the Manchester club the most interested as they consider him to be a suitable replacement for Aleksandar Kolarov .

The Serbian defender is keen to return to Italy after starting just 11 Premier League games for City this season . Gaya is a key player for Valencia , having played 27 league matches this season , and the third-placed La Liga club are putting together a second offer to renew his deal after the first was rejected . Gaya is a Spain Under 21 international , though he was forced to leave the camp last week after suffering a hamstring injury . He is hopeful of being fit for Valencia 's crucial league clash with Villareal at the Mestalla on Sunday .
