Stefan Johansen gratefully picked up two individual prizes at the annual Celtic player of the year awards dinner on Sunday night then looked forward to the team clinching the Scottish Premiership title . The Norway midfielder , 24 , shared the players ' player of the year award with captain Scott Brown but stood alone as the choice of the supporters . And by this weekend the former Stromsgodset player , who joined the Parkhead club in January last year , could have another championship medal to boot . Stefan Johansen has been in terrific form for Celtic this season and has impressed during his first campaign . Ronny Deila 's side went eight points clear of Aberdeen at the top of the table with a 3-0 away win at Dundee United on Sunday , courtesy of a Leigh Griffiths hat-trick . The Hoops will win the league for the fourth successive season if they beat Dundee at home on Friday night and the Dons fail to win against the Tannadice side on Saturday , which would cap a ` special ' campaign for Johansen . ` It 's an amazing feeling , ' he told Celtic 's official website . ` I did n't expect it at all . This is my first full season here so it 's special , especially at a big club like Celtic . The Norwegian picked up two awards and is delighted with the Bhoys ` special ' season . ` With all the great players in the team and how the team has developed this season , it 's an honour to get this prize . ` I 'm proud because when you see all the other players nominated - any one of them could win it . ` We have had a great season and hopefully we can seal the league title now . We just need to continue what we 've been doing . '
