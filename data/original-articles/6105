It is the smallest computer in the world - and 150 of them can fit in a thimble . Called the Michigan Micro Mote , to tiny technology is a complete computer system . Its inventors say it can act as a smart sensor , and give everyday objects computing capabilities . The Michigan Micro Mote is the smallest computer in the world , measuring less than 2 mm across . The Michigan Micro Mote contains solar cells that power the battery with ambient light , including indoor rooms with no natural sunlight , allowing the computers to run perpetually . This line of ` smart dust ' devices includes computers equipped with imagers -LRB- with motion detection -RRB- , temperature sensors , and pressure sensors . By strobing light at a high frequency , the operator is able to send information to the computer . Once the Micro Mote processes the data , it is able to send the information to a central computer via conventional radio frequencies . The Michigan Micro Mote is the first complete , operational computer system measuring as small as two millimeters across . ` To be ` complete , ' a computer system must have an input of data , the ability to process that data - meaning process and store it , make decisions about what to do next -- and ultimately , the ability to output the data . ' Professor David Blaauw explained . ` The sensors are the input and the radios are the output . The other key to being a complete computer is the ability to supply its own power . ' The Michigan Micro Mote contains solar cells that power the battery with ambient light , including indoor rooms with no natural sunlight , allowing the computers to run perpetually . This line of ` smart dust ' devices includes computers equipped with imagers -LRB- with motion detection -RRB- , temperature sensors , and pressure sensors . They are the culmination of work initiated by Blaauw and Sylvester on very low-power processing for millimeter-scale systems . A key breakthrough in the size/power matchup came with the Phoenix processor in 2008 . The Phoenix processor is miniscule at 915 x 915Âµm2 , and boasts ultra-low operating voltage and a unique standby mode that results in an average power consumption of only 500pW . -LRB- Consider that 1pW is the average power consumption of a single human cell . -RRB- . Blaauw explained why Phoenix 's extreme energy efficiency is so important : ` As you shrink down in size , the percentage of the system tends to be dominated by the battery . ` It 's actually not hard to make chips small , but it is hard to make them low power . ` We could have very small chips , but we 'd still end up with really large batteries . ' This line of ` smart dust ' devices includes computers equipped with imagers -LRB- with motion detection -RRB- , temperature sensors , and pressure sensors . One key application for this line of smart sensors lies in personal security and information , its inventors say . The solar system allows the computer to work under indoor lights without ever having to be charged . ` With a 1mm2 solar cell producing 20nW , the device can harvest enough energy under ambient light to run perpetually , ' the team say . The device 's standby power consumption is 2nA . That 's about a million times less power than the average mobile phone consumes while on standby , or the comparative difference between the thickness of a sheet of paper and the length of a football field . There are currently three different systems in the M3 family , focusing on several different applications : sensing temperature , pressure , and taking images . ` Down the road we want these sensors to be able to talk to one another , ' says Blaauw , ` and we 're currently working to extend their range to about 20m . ' The working computer is smaller than a grain of rice programmed and charged via light and could be used for a variety of medical and industrial purposes . One key application for this line of smart sensors lies in personal security and information . Numerous specks of technology could be discretely placed to invisibly monitor a home , business , or personal device . ` We found that a lot of people were very interested in these devices , and that 's why we went with the modular or stacked approach . ' Blaauw explained . ` It 's the key aspect of our design . If you need a different sensing modality you take out one sensor and replace it with another - like mix and match tinker toys . '
