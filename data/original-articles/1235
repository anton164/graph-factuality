He had an initial dip in form after his move but has since kicked on again and has impressed Liverpool scouts in Europe and the French league this season . The 22-year-old was key to Monaco 's Champions League victory over Arsenal , particularly in their first leg performance at The Emirates and is back on the radar of other big clubs . Kondogbia has represented France three times and has made 23 appearances for Monaco this season . Liverpool remain keen on bringing Danny Ings , whose contract expires in the summer , to Anfield from Burnley . Club also monitoring James Milner as his Manchester City contract expires at the end of the season . Liverpool 's budget and attraction will hinge on qualification for the Champions League which Brendan Rodgers admits looks slim . They remain in the frame for James Milner and Danny Ings .
