It was one of Barcelona 's easier nights in the Champions League as Luis Enrique 's team brushed aside Paris Saint-Germain 2-0 at the Nou Camp to reach the semi-finals . The 5-1 aggregate victory never looked in doubt as the Spanish side showed signs of returning to their brilliant best , with a combination of experienced stars and blossoming talent in their ranks . Here Sportsmail looks at the five things we have learned from Barca 's crushing victory over PSG . Neymar -LRB- left -RRB- celebrates opening the scoring for Barcelona along with Dani Alves -LRB- centre -RRB- and Gerard Pique . Neymar is a blend of Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi . He 's just a child , said Juliano Belletti in the week . Some child . Let 's not go overboard ; there 's no way of knowing whether Neymar will reach both the level and consistency of Ronaldo or Messi . But his skill-set and talents seem a combination of those two players , which means he has the potential to be very dangerous indeed . Neymar chases for the ball during the win against Paris Saint Germain in the Champions League quarter-final . Neymar has the blend of Cristiano Ronaldo -LRB- left -RRB- and Lionel Messi in his skillset . Neymar has Messi 's close control when dribbling , he has the flair which Cristiano used to display as a badge of pride -- and winds up opponents in the same way . Both the Real Madrid and Barcelona legends are lethal finishers and Neymar is getting there , as he showed here . There are still parts of his game which he has to improve ; his crossing and final pass sometimes leave a little to be desired . But he is in the right place to hone his skills and barring injury , he will be on the Ballon d'Or podium sooner , rather than later . Luis Enrique has strong chance of matching Pep Guardiola 's treble-winning debut season . Barcelona look like genuine treble contenders . They are in the Copa del Rey final , against Athletic Bilbao . They have a two-point lead in La Liga and only six games remain . And three more victories in the Champions League would see them lift the trophy for the fifth time in their history . There are tough games to come ; none of the semi-finalists will be pushovers . But the brutal way they dismantled a PSG side that knocked out Chelsea , the English champions-in-waiting , in the previous round , shows the level they are at right now . Luis Enrique celebrates with his coaching staff after Neymar 's opening goal at the Nou Camp . They have gone from winning nothing last year to being on the cusp of emulating Pep Guardiola 's treble-winning first season . There 's life in the old dog yet . Lot of reasons have been given for why Andres Iniesta has n't been at his best over the past couple of years . The most recent is that Barcelona 's new style of play has n't allowed him to flourish . He 's having to play in a deeper role , to allow Neymar more space on the left , and offer a bit more protection in a side that features three totally attack-minded forwards . Andres Iniesta charges at the PSG defence for Barcelona as the Spaniard played close to his best . But it was from deep that Iniesta started his run , shimmying away from Edinson Cavani , beating two more PSG players for pace and then feeding in Neymar , who scored , killing the tie . Iniesta may still be acclimatising to the new methods at Barcelona and changes to the way he has played the game for the past decade , but his immense talent will find a way to adapt . PSG project needs more investment -- as long as it 's sensible investment . Having been knocked out of the Champions League 5-1 on aggregate by Barcelona , it 's easily believable that PSG chief Nasser Al-Khelaifi will ready the big bucks to bring a new world star to the club in the summer . Edinson Cavani stands dejected for PSG during the second leg defeat at the Nou Camp . Cavani goes to ground on the touchline in front of PSG boss Laurent Blanc . That really is n't what they need . Bringing another big name into the mix wo n't be helpful ; they need to build a squad . They need to sign players appropriate for positions , rather than trying to crowbar stars into the side . Edinson Cavani is a good example . He was a brilliant centre-forward , right now he 's low on confidence and an ineffective foil for Zlatan Ibrahimovic . Sign , by all means , but sign smart . Barcelona 's big guns blowing apart the landscape . Perhaps then , it was n't helpful for PSG to see the potency of Barcelona 's attacking trio first hand . It took a bit of sculpting , with Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez switching places , but now the terrifying trio up front are flying . Luis Suarez -LRB- left -RRB- Neymar -LRB- centre -RRB- and Lionel Messi celebrate a goal against Atletico Madrid in January . They 're on course to record the highest goal tally for a Barcelona front-line in the past decade . Back in 2011-12 the Messi , Cesc Fabregas and Alexis Sanchez attack managed 101 - including 75 from Messi himself . So far this season Messi , Neymar and Suarez have 95 in all competitions . And if they reach the Champions League final , they have 10 games in which to do it .
