The superstitious will know -- or perhaps those who have seen Alfred Hitchcock 's classic film The Birds -- that a bird in the house is a bad omen and one that is said to equate to death . So a family in Texas would be forgiven for being slightly put out about the fact that their home became infested with them . According to the video maker , who returns home with the other people in the clip to find the infestation , the birds came in through the chimney . The video maker stated that he initially thought the intruders were bats but now believes them to be sparrows . Capturing them on camera as they fly around the room , the man remains very calm while narrating on the carnage before him -- birds crashing into the walls and flying overhead . He says : ` There are birds everywhere , what the hell , look at this , ' before reiterating his point and recoiling as one crashes into him . A female voice then speaks out -- also extremely calmly considering the fact the front room has been turned into an aviary . Despite the infestation of birds in their front room , the family remain very calm throughout the video . According to the video maker the birds managed to invade the house through the chimney . The lady says : ` Careful not to step on them , ' as the video maker points out that some of the birds appear to be dying , as they lie on the ground . The filmmaker then states : ` This is awful , ' and suggests that the group need to find a way to get the birds out of the house . The video concludes with the filmmaker continuing to record the birds as they circle the room and bounce off the walls . The video maker states that the scene is awful as a number of birds crash into the walls and end up on the floor . According to the video maker there were around 30 birds in the front room when the group came home . Speaking on another video , he also states that he initially thought they were bats before realising they were birds and potentially sparrows .
