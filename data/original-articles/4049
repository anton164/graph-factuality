Mario Balotelli moved a step closer to an Anfield exit in the summer as Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers revealed that the Italian had withdrawn himself from the squad to travel to Arsenal after taking a ` slight knock ' in training . The Â£ 16million striker would only have been a substitute against Arsenal and would even have been behind Daniel Sturridge , who also started on the bench , in the pecking order . And Rodgers revealed the striker did not travel with the squad after a sustaining training ground injury on Friday . Mario Balotelli was not included in the Liverpool squad to face Arsenal after picking up a slight knock . Brendan Rodgers revealed that Balotelli withdrew himself from the squad and did not travel to London . ` He trained on Friday afternoon with the team and he took a slight knock to his knee and he deemed himself not able to travel , ' said Rodgers . ` I 'm not a medic . He felt it was too sore to travel . The medical staff have looked at it . It was just something that he himself did n't feel comfortable enough to travel . ' Arsenal ran out 4-1 winners against Liverpool at the Emirates on Saturday . Mesut Ozil scored Arsenal 's second as Hector Bellerin , Alexis Sanchez and Olivier Giroud also netted . Though Rodgers did not question Balotelli 's commitment to the club 's cause , the player has been a constant source of frustration at the club this season , with the manager having previously made it clear that he would have to work much harder to adapt to Liverpool 's style . With just four goals in 25 appearances , his future at the club is already in question -- though he has another three years on his contract .
