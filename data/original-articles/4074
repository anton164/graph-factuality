Alinea , run by the talented Grant Achatz has retained its crown as the best restaurant in the world , the annual poll by luxury magazine Elite Traveler revealed . The top 10 featured four American restaurants which are all in New York . Eleven Madison Park came in at fourth position , while Per Se came seventh and Le Bernardin came ninth . Achatz and his business partner Nick Kokonas opened Alinea in 2005 , and it quickly became one of America 's must-visit restaurants . Having a three-star Michelin star qualifies a restaurant as a place worth traveling to , just to eat at . Achatz 's culinary origins , however , are surprisingly humble . He first started cooking when he was a kid , helping his mom and dad at their diner in Michigan . In July 2007 , once he achieved culinary fame , Achatz had a scare when he was diagnosed with stage IV tongue cancer , which threatened to take away his sense of taste . El Celler de Can Roca , Spain , came in second place . Spain has eight in the list while Italy has seven and Australia had five . However , five months later he was able to beat the disease into remission . The US has 19 of the best restaurants in the world , followed by France which boasts 14 and the UK , which has a mere eight . Spain has eight in the list while Italy has seven and Australia had five . Germany , Japan and China have six restaurants respectively which made it into the top hundred . These include Mizai in Kyoto , Japan which placed at number 15 , Aqua in Wolsberg , Germany , which came in at number 21 and Hong Kong 's Amber . Switzerland , Mexico , Belgium , Singapore and Brazil all had two restaurants each in the list . Three restaurants in South Africa - The Test Kitchen , Cape Town -LRB- 44 -RRB- ; Tasting Room at Le Quartier Francais , Franschhoek -LRB- 85 -RRB- , and Rust en Vrede , Stellenbosch -LRB- 87 -RRB- - were considered the best in the country .
