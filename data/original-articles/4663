England are set to face trial by leg-spin after West Indies captain Denesh Ramdin confirmed Devendra Bishoo will play in Tuesday 's second Test . Wrist spin has long been a bete noire for England batsmen , a quirk that has been passed down the DNA since Australia 's Shane Warne dominated the old enemy for more than a decade . Peter Moores ' current side , with the fresh faces of Gary Ballance , Ben Stokes , Moeen Ali and Jos Buttler throughout the order , have yet to face a frontline leg-spinner in Tests but that will change when Bishoo returns at the National Stadium in Grenada . West Indies cricketer Devendra Bishoo will play against England in the second Test . West Indies captain Denesh Ramdin confirmed that leg-spinner Bishoo will play on Tuesday . His record over 11 caps is modest , with 40 wickets at 39.55 , but the 29-year-old comes into the game in place of the dropped Sulieman Benn in superb form . His last five first-class matches for Guyana have yielded a phenomenal 37 wickets with six wicket hauls against Barbados , Trinidad & Tobago and the Windward Islands . ` Bishoo will be in , ' said Ramdin , when asked about his bowling line-up . West Indies captain Ramdin prepares for the second Test in the nets . ` The pitch will turn out to be better - in terms of spin - than the first Test in Antigua . He has bowled really well in first-class cricket in the last month and a half . ` In our squad 's practice match he bowled long spells and got results . ` It 's going to be a batting track for the first two days and then the fourth and five days , the spinner will come into play . ` With a leg-spinner you get bad balls and you get beauties . Hopefully he 'll get a lot of beauties in this game . '
