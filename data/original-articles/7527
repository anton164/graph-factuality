A trucker has been caught on camera launching an extraordinary foul-mouthed tirade at another motorist after a crash along the M6 . In footage shot from a dashboard camera on Sunday , the trucker lets rip after a car towing a caravan moves into his lane and the two vehicles collide . Eventually the car towing the caravan jackknifes , coming to rest across the front of the van , blocking the slip road - believed to be junction 8 with the M5 , near Birmingham . This is the moment a van driver unleashes a foul-mouthed tirade at another motorist -LRB- pictured -RRB- after the man moves into his lane and the two vehicles collide , ending with the car stopped across the lorry 's bonnet . As the footage begins it shows the car indicating to turn into the slip road , before moving across , despite there being little or no space between the van and the car in front . The footage was posted on Shropshire-based Facebook user Mark Hazell 's account and was viewed around 2million times in less than 48 hours before being removed . As the car driver got out to survey the scene , the trucker ranted : ` F ****** w ***** . What the f *** are you doing coming over on me ? ` What are you doing , you f ******* idiot , you come over on me ? You had no ... cos you indicate , you had no f ****** gap ? Where were you ? Were you in front of me ? You d ******* . ' With his turn-off rapidly approaching , the car driver makes a dive for the inside lane , moving across the path of the van before the two vehicles collide with one another . The car momentarily disappears from view before a loud crunching noise is heard , and the car spins around to stop up against the van 's bonnet -LRB- pictured -RRB- . After the accident , blocked the slip road , the car driver -LRB- pictured here wearing the striped top -RRB- jumps out to argue , with the van driver sending a torrent of abuse back . The heated swearing tirade continued before the trucker told the driver : ` I 've got it all on camera . Good . The f ****** idiot , absolute f ****** idiot . ' The crash happened on a stretch of the M6 hit by speed restrictions and lane closures because of roadworks . Responding to comments left on Facebook , Mr Hazell said he had two more videos of the crash which he would hand over to police .
