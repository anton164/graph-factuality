Roy Keane described Paris Saint-Germain defender David Luiz as ` lost ' following his woeful first-half performance against Barcelona on Tuesday night . The Â£ 50million former Chelsea man was at fault for both goals as Neymar sent the Ligue 1 side bowing out of the Champions League with little more than a whimper . Keane , known as one of punditry 's scariest characters , is n't usually one for holding back when it comes to opinions , but even he had some sympathy for the Brazilian international . PSG defender David Luiz -LRB- right -RRB- had a torrid time marking Barcelona forward Neymar on Tuesday night . Luiz was at fault for both of Neymar 's goals as PSG crashed out of the Champions League quarter-finals . ITV pundit Roy Keane offered his sympathy to Luiz , describing the defender 's performance as looking ` lost ' ` I actually feel sorry for him , ' the 43-year-old told ITV . ` He just looks lost again ; we spoke about him before the game . ` He does n't smell danger and the stuff there is literally schoolboy stuff . ` You 've got to give the boy sympathy , a little bit . Because he does n't look like he knows what he 's doing . It was fellow Brazilian international Neymar that stole the headlines as his double sealed Barcelona 's progression . Neymar set the tone for the game when he slotted home the opener following some fine work from Andres Iniesta before later heading a second past Salvatore Sirigu . And Luiz was quick to admit that his side got what they deserved across both legs of the fixture . ` They were a better team than us in both games . They controlled both games and they deserved to qualify , ' he told ITV . ` We did n't take the opportunities to score in the first match . We did n't play well , but we had seven or eight opportunities . In this game , they were better than us . ' Neymar has been in superb form for Barcelona this season , taking his scoring tally to 30 against PSG .
