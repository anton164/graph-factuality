Inter Milan have opened discussions with Manchester City about Stevan Jovetic . The Serie A club have proposed an initial loan deal for the forward but City are unwilling to let him leave on a temporary basis . Jovetic looks likely to leave the Etihad this summer after being omitted from the club 's Champions League squad earlier this season to make room for January signing Wilfried Bony . Inter Milan have opened talks with Manchester City regarding a deal for forward Stevan Jovetic . Jovetic , pictured scoring against Sunderland in December , looks likely to leave the Etihad this summer . Inter Milan boss Roberto Mancini is hoping to raid his former club Manchester City this summer . The Premier League champions rejected several bids from Inter last summer , while Juventus showed interest in the Montenegro star during the last transfer window . City are willing to listen to offers for Jovetic if they can recoup a significant amount of the Â£ 22million they paid Fiorentina for him in 2013 . Inter are unlikely to turn Lukas Podolski 's loan move from Arsenal into a permanent one , leaving Roberto Mancini in the market for a wide forward . The former City boss also remains keen on a deal for Yaya Toure , who could be one of several players to leave the Premier League champions this summer . Inter are also interested in a deal for midfielder Yaya Toure , pictured celebrating a goal against Sunderland . Veteran midfielder Toure , pictured in action against Newcastle , is one of a number of players who could leave . Speaking earlier this month , Mancini said : ` Yaya has played in every top League , apart from Germany and Italy . ` If , as it seems , he wants to have an experience in Italy , then there is this possibility he could come here . ` It wo n't be easy , but he 's a player with incredible technique and character . Would Inter be his first choice ? That 's certain . '
