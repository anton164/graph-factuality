This is the dramatic moment a brave village watchman fought off a wild leopard armed with only a stick in India . The incident took place in Olani village , four kilometres from Manpur , in central India and was recorded by terrified villagers from the relative safety of hut rooftops . To try and protect his fellow villagers , the fearless ward ran towards the leopard brandishing the weapon . The brave village watchman stands on guard with his stick as the leopard moves towards him . Watched on by a crowd of bystanders , the ward beats the leopard twice on the head as it tries to slash him with its claws . Even though the man sits defenceless on the dusty earth , he continues to fend off the leopard with his stick . After a few terrifying seconds , the leopard - inches away from the man 's bare feet - eventually runs off . He managed to strike the big cat on the head twice before it retaliated , dumping the ward to the ground . Astonished bystanders could be heard screaming as the leopard stood at the feet of the seemingly doomed man . Despite being injured on the floor and unable to move , the courageous ward continued to fend off the leopard with his stick and after a few seconds the animal ran off . Mahendra Sharma , a school teacher , said : ` Even the armed forest officials seldom muster courage to fight a beast . ' According to local media , the man did not suffer any serious injuries as a result of his death-defying encounter . In last year 's Indian elections , rural communities blamed the government for placing them at risk of leopard attacks by failing to provide basic infrastructure such as electrical lighting and street lighting . The dramatic incident recorded by a terrified onlooker took place in Olani village , in central India .
