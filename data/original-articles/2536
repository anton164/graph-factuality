As Captain Ross Poldark , his brooding good looks and rippling muscles have sent women around the country into a frenzy . But Aidan Turner 's Poldark co-star Heida Reed has claimed the obsession with his body is sexist , and is unintentionally undermining the BBC1 series . Miss Reed , 27 , who stars in the period drama as Poldark 's former lover Elizabeth , said Turner , 31 , was being ` objectified ' in a way that would not be tolerated if he were female . Poldark star Heida Reed has claimed audiences ' obsession with Aidan Turner 's -LRB- pictured body is sexist . Claiming it is evidence of reverse sexism , Miss Reed said : ` I think there should be the same standard for both sexes when it comes to things like this . ` Of course it 's nice for everyone involved that he 's viewed as a sex symbol or very attractive man . But it 's getting a little bit ridiculous . I think it just undermines the rest of the show . ` I do n't think it should be any more allowed than if a woman was in the same situation . And if she was , the media would have a field day that she 's being objectified . ' Reed said she knew ` for a fact that -LSB- Turner is -RSB- completely baffled by the amount of interest ' in the popularity of images that show him scything in a field . ` The producers had no idea that was going to happen either , ' she explained . ` They never said ` let 's have his shirt taken off and everyone will go nuts ' . It was n't a strategy . ' The Icelandic actress 's comments follow overwhelming interest in Turner 's physique from Poldark 's avid fans . Hundreds of viewers have taken to Twitter to marvel at his strapping form , as scenes showed him swimming naked in the sea and scything a field topless . One joked on Twitter : ` If Poldark gets any hotter we 'll have to call the fire brigade . ' Another told MailOnline : ` There is n't a single woman I know , who does n't think he 's absolutely gorgeous . ' And they even complained after last week 's episode failed to feature Turner 's bare chest . One posted : ` All bad news on the Poldark front tonight . @Aidan did n't get his shirt off once . ' However while fans ' interest might be taken for flattery , Miss Reed said Turner , who is reportedly engaged to his girlfriend of four years , actress Sarah Greene , is ` completely baffled ' by the level of attention , which has included online marriage proposals . Heida Reed pictured with her popular co-star in a scene from the TV series Poldark . Miss Reed , who is currently starring in a play about revenge porn called Scarlet , in which she appears on stage in just her underwear was speaking to the Daily Telegraph . Poldark , which is based on the books by Winston Graham , has followed Ross Poldark since he returned from the American War of Independence only to find that his father has died and his former fianc√©e , Elizabeth , has married another man . He rescues Demelza , played by Eleanor Tomlinson , 22 , from life as a street urchin and takes her in as his maid . And their relationship develops from a working one to one of passion , climaxing with a steamy bedroom scene . The final instalment of Poldark airs on BBC1 tomorrow at 9 pm .
