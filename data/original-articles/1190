Leaving a favourite dog in kennels while travelling abroad can be a source of profound guilt . But one owner was so overwhelmed with anxiety at the thought of being parted from her pet , she decided to take the dog on her frequent journeys overseas . As a result , May Wong 's four-year-old cockapoo , Miss Darcy , has travelled the globe - visiting 11 countries and 23 destinations including New York , Berlin , Stockholm , Milan and Paris . She takes more trips with her owner every year than the average Briton and has covered nearly 25,000 miles since 2011 - making her a real-life Phileas Dog . Scroll down for video . C'est la vie !

Seasoned traveller : Cockapoo Darcy in shades as she takes in the sun in Nice in the south of France . Now the pair have been joined on their trips by Miss Wong 's new dog , George . The dogs have travelled on planes , trains , cars and ferries across the world and sleep in dog-friendly hotels with their 55-year-old-owner . Among the landmarks they have visited are the Eiffel Tower , New York 's Central Park and the Berlin Wall . Miss Darcy , who took 12 trips with her owner last year alone , has become such a seasoned traveller she is familiar with boarding procedures at stations and airports . Her interior designer owner said : ` Over time and effort , travelling with Darcy has become routine . ` I know her ways and by now she 's familiar with being in trains , waiting around in stations , boarding procedures for ferries and planes . She is a very calm dog . I am lucky that she is a very good traveller . Boat trip : Darcy with her owner May Wong on board the Queen Mary in the Atlantic returning from New York . ` My dogs are my best friends , my family -- and I enjoy exploring places with them . Having them with me makes me more relaxed during my holidays rather than thinking about them and worrying if they are okay . ' Research from pet insurer Petplan has found that 65 per cent of people experience separation anxiety from their pets when holidaying - something which Miss Wong has struggled with . She tried leaving her dogs with friends , dog trainers and kennels but felt distressed by finding them unhappy and , on occasions , unwashed , on her return . Miss Wong , from London , said : ` On occasions when I had left Miss Darcy behind with friends , she 's constantly on the lookout for me when she was out walking . She was restless and listening out for me all the time , whining , which is out of character for her . ` They may not necessarily appreciate the effort I go through to have them travel with me but I know they would rather be with me than not . ' Before going abroad , Miss Wong researches dog-friendly hotels and restaurants so she can eat and sleep with her dogs . She said : ` We 've travelled by rail , car , plane and ferry . Being checked into cargo on a plane is not the most pleasant way for pets to get places . I would do so only if it is absolutely necessary in order to get my pets to where I will be if I am gone for long periods . Globe-trotter : Dressed up to visit Kylemore Abbey , Ireland , left , and watching the sunset in Manhattan , right . Public transport : Darcy is used to all forms of travel . Pictured : On a train before arriving in Bruges , Belgium . ` I am most concerned about their comfort level and have restricted our vacations to places where I can take them and where it is safe for them to go to . ` There are obviously occasions where I need to travel further afield and that are not worth risking their safety to bring them along . ' Inga MacKellar , Petplan 's pet behaviourist , said pet separation anxiety can be felt by both pet owners and their animals . She said : ` Dogs are as social a species as we are , so it is not surprising that some dogs ca n't cope with being left by themselves . ` On the other hand , we know that cats are a solitary species and many like to spend time on their own - however , whilst most separation problems are usually seen in dogs , it does n't mean that all cats are happy to accept being alone . ` Some can become over attached to their owners and also suffer from separation problems . ` Separation anxiety can vary in intensity , with signs including restlessness and panting , howling , destruction or messing . ` Knowing that 65 per cent of pet owners experience separation anxiety themselves when leaving their pets , with symptoms including uneasiness or restlessness , it 's evident how much our pets mean to us .
