Belgian attacker Mirallas was one of Everton 's top performers in the first half of the campaign . ` I know there have been a couple of times he 's had quotes translated from interviews . I do n't think anything he has said is disrespectful or out of the norm . The way I see it he 's one of those players who loves playing football and he has n't got any other motivation . ` He still has a two year contract . If he were out of contract , I would be worried , but all I want is for him to be fully recovered . ' Mirallas has made no secret of his ambition to play in the Champions League .

I think he 's brought know-how and experience but also that freshness of wanting to show what he can do . ` The next seven games will be very important to see if he can carry on enjoying his football and then like any loan situation it 's a three way conversation that , first of all , the player needs to see that experience as a positive one and then we 'll see what the parent club wants to do . ` But it 's not a decision we need to make now . The next seven games is an eternity in football . ' Lennon is all smiles as Everton train ahead of their weekend fixture against Swansea City .
