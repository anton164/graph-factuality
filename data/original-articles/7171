It 's the hallowed turf where the modern day game of rugby was born when one of its pupils picked up a football and ran with it in the early 19th century . Rugby School is known as the spiritual home of the game , with the World Cup trophy named the Webb Ellis Cup in honour of the schoolboy called William who made the daring decision to disregard the rules in 1823 . Today the school is still steeped in the traditions of the sport , alongside its own rich history of ` muscular Christianity ' led by its most famous headmaster , Dr Thomas Arnold who is credited with transforming Rugby School 's values in an effort to build pupils ' characters . Here is modern-day portrait of a historic British institution , by photographer Neil Hall .
