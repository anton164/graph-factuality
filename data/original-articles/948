This dog 's certainly not setting a good example to the youngsters under her charge . Gemma the pit bull was filmed at home in California being fed some treats . But in a bid to trick her , her owner throws a broccoli spear into the mix . Immediately the canine pulls a look of disgust as she chomps on the vegetable . She then proceeds to spit it out on the floor . Let 's hope the two children she lives with do n't follow her lead and they learn to love their greens . When she 's not filling her face , other videos show Gemma enjoys sleeping and hanging out with her human family . Yuck : Gemma the pit bull was filmed at home in California being fed some treats , but in a bid to trick her , her owner throws a broccoli spear into the mix . Not a broccoli fan : Immediately the canine pulls a look of disgust as she chomps on the vegetable - she then proceeds to spit it out on the floor .
