A cheeky monkey was captured on camera snatching a banana from a female tourist before slapping her GoPro when she got too close . Filmed in the Thai town of Kanchanaburi , the monkey approaches the woman , who holds a banana , with its outstretched hands . Grabbing it in both hands , the monkey takes a small bite before pulling it from its skin , which he leaves with the lady . Removing her hand from the shot , the lady can be heard laughing as the greedy monkey begins tucking into the banana while its friends sit around and watch . Moving in for a closer look , the woman leans forward and the monkey copies her by lunging forward itself . Getting right up into the camera 's lens the monkey appears to sniff it while diverting its eyes , as if hoping that it is food . The cheeky money snatches the banana from the woman 's hand and begins scoffing it down . Realising that it is out of luck , it returns to its original position and continues tucking into the banana . The lady once again begins moving closer to the monkey , but the primate is less keen to play this time . Cradling its food under its arm as if protecting it from the oncoming threat , the monkey raises its left hand and gives the camera a slap . Up close and personal ! The curious monkey gets right up to the camera lens and gives it a sniff . Startled by the monkey 's reaction , its friend who sits next to it looks genuinely shocked and rather hilariously raises its eyebrows in surprise . The video concludes with the monkey , satisfied that the threat has gone , eating the remainder of the banana . The footage was captured by Maja and Diano , a pair who describe themselves on their YouTube channel as a ` young married couple with an impulse to explore , film and edit great travel moments . ' Slap ! The lady gets too close to the monkey and it reacts by giving her camera a smack .
