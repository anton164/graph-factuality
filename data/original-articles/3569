Ten-man Southampton lifted the Premier League U21 Cup , but they needed extra time , and a brilliant winner , to see off a stubborn Blackburn side . The game was settled shortly before the break in the additional half hour , when Sam Gallagher unleashed a wonder-strike from long-range , after the two-legged tie had ended 1-1 after 180 minutes . Gallagher , who made 18 Premier League appearances for the club last season , but has not been in the first team this time around , smashed a left-footed shot into the bottom corner from 25 yards , giving Blackburn keeper David Raya no chance , after cutting in from the right wing and playing a one-two with Josh Sims .

Southampton were reduced to 10 men late on in normal time , when midfielder Harrison Reed , who had been superb in the goalless first leg , was dismissed for a second bookable offence .
