Selfie sticks and extreme sports are not designed to go together , as a snowboarder in Japan proved . While enjoying the slopes in the country 's Chiisagata District , the man can be seen decked out in purple holding a matching selfie stick at arm 's length . Recording himself from behind , the man begins his descent of the mountain and a skier can be seen just in front of him . Weaving down the slope , the snowboarder initially appears to make a success of the video and he even causes the snow to spray in the air while turning . Picking up the speed , the man heads in the direction of the chairlifts before moving away again -- adjusting his selfie stick to capture himself from the front in the process . But as the confident snowboarder adjusts the camera , he is oblivious to the chairlift swinging into view behind . The snowboarder , in a bright purple jacket , is using a selfie stick to film himself in action . The show-off stops to clear some snow off the screen of the camera , not realising what is about to happen . It is later explained online that there was too much snow and that the chairlift was therefore lower to the ground than it would normally be . As the snowboarder in the purple jacket turns to his companion and appears to talk , the empty chairlift deals him a heavy blow to the head . And the final indignity sees the boarder fall to the ground while still filming himself . The snowboarder can be heard making a scream as he holds the back of his head and falls to the floor . Realising his mistake , the snowboarder concludes the video by shuffling himself out of the way and sitting beside the chairlift as another passes safely by . The empty chairlift appears out of nowhere and clatters the snowboarder over the head . And the final indignity sees the snowboarder fall to the ground while still filming himself .
