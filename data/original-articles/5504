Forget a feather down pillow - this boy would rather use his cat 's belly as a place to rest his head . California-based YouTube user Lionel Hutz filmed his young son chasing the family feline around the garden in a bid to get some rest . Footage shows the cat licking his fur before his human friend comes along and plonks himself on top . After a brief moment of stillness , the cat immediately gets up and scurries over to another spot . The boy then proceeds to follow the pet to his new location . Eager to get some rest , the infant repeats the same move and rolls to the ground . The sequence happens one more time before the cat decides he 's had enough of being used as a pillow and wanders off indoors . A later video shows the duo swiftly made up , and the boy is seen gently feeding the cat handfuls of treats .
