Atletico Madrid striker Mario Mandzukic is still bruised from a physical Champions League quarter-final first leg against Real Madrid but is expected to be fit for the return at the Bernabeu on Wednesday , said coach Diego Simeone . The Croatian suffered a cut to the top of the nose from an elbow by Sergio Ramos and fellow Real defender Dani Carvajal punched him in the stomach , an incident unseen by the referee , during the clash at the Calderon that ended 0-0 . Mandzukic also suffered an ankle injury that forced him to miss Saturday 's 2-1 win at Deportivo La Coruna in La Liga but he is now back in training although showing the marks of his encounter with Ramos . Mario Mandzukic was battered and bruised during Atletico Madrid 's Champions League quarter-final tie . Atletico and rivals Real Madrid drew 0-0 in the first leg which was dominated by second half scraps . ` We had a training session yesterday with two groups where we were making changes and he was fine , ' Simeone told a news conference on Tuesday . ` We now have another training session where we expect him to be okay and I will base my plan , which I have fairly clearly in mind , around that . ' Mandzukic is favourite , ahead of Fernando Torres , to play in attack alongside Antoine Griezmann who took his time to settle in at Atletico but is now in a rich vein of form . ` He has developed a lot since he arrived and the goals that he has scored in La Liga show that , ' said Simeone . France international Griezmann hit both goals against Deportivo and has 20 in La Liga . ` He has adapted to a new position very well and is starting to show his potential . He is still young and he can improve but he is on the right lines to do that , ' added Simeone . Blood pours from Mandzukic 's face during the Champions League quarter-final first leg in Madrid . But Atletico manager Diego Simeone says Mandzukic should be fit for the second leg clash on Wednesday .
