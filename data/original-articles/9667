Nathan Hughes on Friday night had his ban for accidentally knocking out George North sensationally over-turned on appeal , following an outcry on his behalf . The Wasps No 8 was initially suspended for three matches , after a disciplinary panel ruled he had been ` reckless ' for failing to prevent his knee colliding with the head of the Welsh Lion , as he scored a try for Northampton on March 27 . Hughes was shown a red card for the offence , but that dismissal has now been officially rescinded . Although it was accepted that there had been no intent , the Fiji-born player with England ambitions received a further sanction at the original hearing . Yet , in a stunning twist -- and in light of fierce criticism -- the ban was thrown out , as the appeal lodged by Wasps was up-held . Nathan Hughes 's knee collided with George North 's head as he crossed the line to score for Northampton . North was left out cold on the pitch at Franklin 's Gardens and had to be taken off on a stretcher . It was the third time that the Wales and Lions winger had been knocked out in the space of two months . Fiji-born forward Hughes missed his side 's Champions Cup quarter-final loss against Toulon last Sunday . North was left unconscious by the clash ; a third blow to the head in the space of two months . He has since been advised to take a minimum of a month off from playing , to counter-act his concussion symptoms . Graphic , slow-motion footage of the incident at Franklin 's Gardens led some observers to condemn Hughes , but many more spoke up in his defence . Wasps were incensed that the forward had been suspended -- and their dismay was shared by others outside the club . Captain James Haskell said : ` Astounded would be an under-statement ' , while fly-half Andy Goode added : ` Really ca n't believe or understand the ban for Nathan Hughes . There was no intent and I feel the accident has been judged on outcome . ' Former England player Austin Healey branded the sentence a ` total joke ' and Harlequins captain Joe Marler echoed his sentiment , calling it an ` absolute joke ' . Hughes was sent off and then banned for three weeks following the incident on March 27 . Hughes missed his club 's Champions Cup defeat to holders Toulon last Sunday , as he awaited his appeal hearing . He is now free to return to action immediately , but he is not in the match-day squad for Wasps ' Aviva Premiership trip to London Welsh tomorrow and given the formality of a victory in that fixture , he is unlikely to play again until the visit of Exeter to Coventry on April 26 . Jeremy Summers , chairman of the appeal hearing panel , said : ` The appeal panel considered it appropriate to hear the matter afresh . Having done so and having had the advantage of evidence not before the original panel , it concluded that no act of foul play took place in that the incident occurred accidentally . '
