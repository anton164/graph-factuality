Sending post to space is problematic , so when a teenager from Houston , Texas , wanted to send a message to her astronaut father , she had to be creative . 13-year-old Stephanie decided that long-distance phone calls were n't enough and she wanted to given her father a visual note of how much she missed him while he was away . The next time the NASA employee was up in space , she decided to create a huge art project in the desert that he would be able to see from the International Space Station . The message 13-year-old Stephanie wrote to her father in Nevada 's Delamar Dry Lake . Her father is a keen photographer and likes to take pictures of the earth when he is floating in space . Stephanie thought she could use his hobby to send him a message from back on earth . She enlisted the help of car manufacturer Hyundai to make the earth drawing , that has now broken a world record for its size . The car company used eleven sedans to draw the message on the land in Nevada 's Delamar Dry Lake , that read ` Steph -LSB- hearts -RSB- you ! ' using coordinates and a helicopter . Stephanie drew the note on paper and worked with Hyundai to get it copied onto a large land surface . 11 cars wrote the message in the dusty land in Nevada 's Delamar Dry Lake using coordinates and a helicopter . Her father took a picture of the image from space to show his daughter that her plan had worked . Measuring 5,556,411.86 square metres or 59,808,480.26 square feet , the Guinness World Record has now declared it the largest tire track image ever . The scheme has been made into a video for Hyundai 's New Thinking Campaign . Stephanie 's father taking pictures of the message from the International Space Station .
