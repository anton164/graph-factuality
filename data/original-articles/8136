Atletico Madrid centre back Miranda has lambasted Serbian referee Milorad Mazic following his side 's Champions League encounter against Real Madrid . The Brazil international criticised Mazic 's display after the goalless draw at the Vicente Calderon and questioned why officials from ` minor leagues ' were able to referee such a high-profile clash . Miranda and his Atletico Madrid team-mates were left riled when Mazic , who refereed at the 2014 World Cup , failed to punish Sergio Ramos for what appeared to be an elbow on Mario Mandzukic . Miranda was far from happy with Milorad Mazic 's performance during Atletico 's Champions League clash . The Brazil defender has said officials from ` lower leagues ' should not be allowed to referee high-profile games . Mario Mandzukic makes a point to referee Mazic after being cut by an elbow from Sergio Ramos . ` I wo n't talk about the referee , but I think referees from minor leagues should not be in charge of this kind of game , ' Miranda told AS . ` We had chances to win but Madrid also had theirs . We had a very bad first half and we were better in the second . ` Now we have to go get the win -LSB- in the second leg -RSB- . It 's a tough game and we will go for the win . We can qualify by scoring a goal . ' Miranda is not the only Atletico Madrid star to hit out at Mazic as team-mate Mario Suarez has also taken a swipe at the Serbian official . Suarez expressed his frustration after the game , saying on Spanish TV : ` The referee is very bad . They ca n't use a Serbian referee for these type of games , with all my respect . ` I hope that in the return leg they pick a better referee . ' Mario Suarez has also blasted the performance of referee Mazic after being booked on Tuesday night .
