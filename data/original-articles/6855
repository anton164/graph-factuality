I have had him for ten years - he is my little baby . I just want him home safe . I 'm so worried . I do n't know who could do that to someone , ' she said . ` I do n't know if it is a hoax or if he has really been stolen by someone . It is scary . It was a man on the phone and he sounded middle aged . He said he would cut Ben up .

She said that while it was possible he could have escaped it was very out of character and was unlikely that he would n't return . She said : ` There was a little hole in the hedge that he might have got through , but it is very out of character for him not to come back . ` We went straight out looking for him but there has been no sign of him ever since . I am worried he has been stolen and somebody has him in their garage . ' A social media campaign , started by her neighbours , is becoming increasingly popular in the hope of returning the pet . She added : ` Friends in the area have been great and I have so much support from people . We are all worried sick and must have driven about 300 miles in the past week just looking for him . ` Sometimes we cross paths with other people out doing the same thing . The entire family is worried and stressed out about him . We 've always been a dog-loving family - I have had dogs ever since I was little . Ben is the smallest one we 've ever had and he is a member of the family now .
