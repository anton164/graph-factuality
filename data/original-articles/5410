Chelsea are interested in Fulham goalkeeper Marcus Bettinelli . Manager Jose Mourinho was in the crowd at Craven Cottage last Wednesday to watch the 22-year-old in Fulham 's 1-1 draw against Rotherham United . Bettinelli only made his debut for Fulham this season and has one more year left on his contract . Fulham goalkeeper Marcus Bettinelli has caught the eye of Chelsea and Jose Mourinho who watched him play in a 1-1 draw against Rotherham . Chelsea are braced for the departure of second choice goalkeeper Petr Cech -LRB- right -RRB- in the summer . The club will sit down with him to discuss a new contract but Fulham are anticipating an offer from Chelsea over the coming weeks . He is an England Under-21 international after playing against the Czech Republic last month . Mourinho sees him as potential back-up to Thibaut Courtois and Petr Cech is expected to move on in the summer with Paris Saint-Germain favourites to sign him . Bettinelli , who made his first-team debut for Fulham only last August , is the son of Fulham academy goalkeeping coach Vic Bettinelli , who also coaches Mourinho 's son , Jose Mario . Chelsea manager Mourinho -LRB- left -RRB- believes Bettinelli could potentially provide back-up for Thibaut Courtois .
