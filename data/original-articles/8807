John Carver will turn to Siem de Jong in a bid to save Newcastle 's sorry season . The Â£ 6million summer signing suffered a collapsed lung in February and it was initially feared he would miss the remainder of the campaign , especially as it was the second time he had fallen victim to the problem . De Jong has started just one Premier League game since arriving from Ajax and he was only days away from a return to action following a five-month layoff with a torn thigh muscle when he was diagnosed with the collapsed lung . Newcastle attacking midfielder Siem de Jong could return to action before the end of the current campaign . De Jong , pictured in training on April 9 with his team-mates , will feature for Newcastle 's reserve side . However , the 26-year-old returned to training earlier this month and will now feature for United 's reserves when they entertain Derby County at St James ' Park on Wednesday night , as will England Under 19 winger Rolando Aarons . Sunday 's visit of Spurs will probably come too soon for De Jong and hamstring absentee Aarons -- who has not played since November - but Carver will be desperately hoping to have them available for the final five matches of a season which is in danger of ending on a sour note . Newcastle have lost five on the spin and their head coach has admitted that he does not know where the next point is coming from . They have scored just once in eight hours and would be fighting relegation had it not been for a five-match winning run under Alan Pardew last autumn . Supporters are organising a boycott ahead of the televised clash with Spurs , where thousands are expected to stay away in protest at Mike Ashley 's running of the club . Newcastle boss John Carver will be hoping his side will improve following the return of De Jong .
