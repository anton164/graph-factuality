Pablo Osvaldo has urged Italian legends Andrea Pirlo and Francisco Totti to move continents and join him at Argentinian giants Boca Juniors . The 29-year-old moved to his current side on a loan deal from Southampton and has become an instant hit - scoring three goals in six games . Osvaldo believes that the duo would be a good fit for Boca , and says the fans would love to have them line up on the La Bombonera pitch . Pablo Osvaldo thinks that his former team-mates Andrea Pirlo and Francesco Totti should move to Boca . ` Who I would like to join me at Boca ? Pirlo and Totti , ' the 29-year-old told Corriere dello Sport . ` I have played with many great players over the years and many of them are my friends . I do n't want to do injustice to anyone , but if I had to pick two , it would be Pirlo and Totti . ` They have a bit of a South-American style and they would be perfect for Boca with their abilities . ` The Bombonera would go absolutely crazy for players like them . ' Pirlo has established himself as one of the best midfielders in world football and is hugely popular . Totti -LRB- 10 -RRB- is a Roma legend and Osvaldo feels that he would be just as loved if he moved to Argentina .
