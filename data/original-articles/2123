In an earlier report , Lt Mark Maret told CBS : ` We do n't know if this was to try and resurrect the spirit of the child and we do n't know if this was to try and resurrect the child themselves or what exactly that service or ceremony encompasses . ' Unconfirmed reports have suggested that the two-year-old boy , whose name is unknown and who neighbors had not seen , may have died either of starvation or of a fall from a chair . Emergency services do not appear to have called until police received an anonymous tip four days later . Police said there is no record of the child 's death being reported .

A neighbor told Daily Mail Online earlier this month that five children under the age of ten , both boys and girls , were also living at the home and had been taken away by Child Protective Services . Joy Donaldson said that she once complained to the woman who lived at the home about two of the boys , who had been bothering her dogs . The woman , whose name she did not know , told her that the children did not know any better ` because they had been taken off the streets of Mexico ' . A second neighbor , Jean Turnipseed , told Daily Mail Online that she had heard that church services were taking place at the home on Saturdays and Sunday nights , where people were being charged at the door . An investigation is underway involving both state and federal authorities .
