Tottenham target Kevin Wimmer will move to England this summer , according to Austria manager Marcel Koller . The Cologne defender , who is wanted by Spurs in a £ 4.4 million deal , has impressed the boss of his national team as well as scouts at White Hart Lane this season . Earlier this week Wimmer confirmed that the two clubs were yet to agree a fee but that now appears to have changed after comments from Koller . Cologne 's 22-year-old Austria international defender Kevin Wimmer is a £ 4.4 million target for Tottenham . He says it would be a ` dream ' to join a top club like Spurs and would relish the challenge of English football . He said : ` He has played exactly the same as I 've seen him do already in Cologne . On the ball he is very calm , not rushed . ` He switches in the summer to England . With his young age he still has potential to improve . He has it all . ' Wimmer has admitted that it would be a ` dream ' to join Mauricio Pochettino 's side this summer . He told Laola TV : ` The two clubs have yet to agree because of the transfer fee . They are still negotiating . Wimmer , who has one senior international cap for Austria , would help Spurs bolster their defensive options . ` It would be a dream to move to a top club like Tottenham . For me , the transfer is a big step , a step with which I can develop myself . That 's why I want to take the chance . ` I 'm not someone who wants to stop developing . That is why England would be the next step . I 'm playing in Germany . This is pretty much the best league in the world . ` The English Premier League is the only one that can match that . For me , the English league would be a great challenge . There I can develop because it 's very demanding . I 'm a fan of English football . '
