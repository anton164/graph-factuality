' The story was recently brought to the small screen in the BBC adaption starring Damian Lewis as Henry VIII and Mark Rylance as his adviror Thomas Cromwell . The mini-series received rave reviews when it aired earlier this year , and was dubbed BBC 2 's most successful drama in a decade after drawing in four million viewers . Critics praised its story , acting and historical accuracy as makers went to such great lengths to recreate the Tudor period they used only candlelight to illuminate night-time scenes , filmed on location using special cameras .

Mantel , who saw sales of her books boosted by the adaptation , had said ahead of the BBC version that she refused to ` dumb down ' to suit a broad television audience .

The plays , written by Mike Poulton , sold out at Stratford-upon-Avon and quickly transferred to London , where they received critical raves , broke box office records and triumphed as the West End 's biggest hit plays . Reprising their performances from the London production , Ben Miles as Cromwell , Nathaniel Parker as Henry VIII and Lydia Leonard as Anne Boleyn will be going over to Broadway . Mantel is currently writing her third novel in the Cromwell trilogy titled The Mirror and The Light .
