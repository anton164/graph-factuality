Inter Milan are prepared to offer Yaya Toure a five-year contract to lure him away from Manchester City this summer . Despite the fact Toure turns 32 next month , Roberto Mancini is so desperate to sign the powerful midfielder that he 's ready to give the Ivory Coast midfielder a deal that will see him play beyond his 37th birthday . Mancini , who signed Toure for Manchester City in 2010 , is working hard behind the scenes to bring Toure to Serie A next season . Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure remains a top target for Serie A giants Inter Milan . Toure , pictured with Vincent Kompany , will be offered a new deal by Manchester City in the summer . Former Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini is keen on bringing Toure to the San Siro . The Italian believes Toure has the capacity to dominate games in Serie A well into his mid-30s , like Juventus midfielder Andrea Pirlo has . The midfielder 's representatives are fully aware of Inter 's interest and are keeping their options open going into the summer . City want to keep Toure , who currently earns Â£ 220,000-per-week , and will offer him a new contract at the end of the season , which will also include the opportunity to take up an ambassadorial role at the club when his playing days are over . But Inter will test City 's resolve to keep Toure this summer and hope the prospect of a long-term deal will be enough to persuade the former Barcelona to leave England . The 31-year-old scored a consolation goal in Manchester City 's surprise 2-1 defeat by Crystal Palace . Toure walks off the Selhurst Park pitch following his side 's Premier League defeat at Selhurst Park .
