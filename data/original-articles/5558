Adrian Peterson is to meet with the NFL to discuss his reinstatement . The Minnesota Vikings running back played once last season before being placed on the Commissioner 's Exempt list due to a child abuse case . The 30-year-old was was due to be reinstated on April 15 , but according to NFL media insider Ian Rapoport , Peterson will meet with the NFL this week . Peterson 's situation is far from clear , with the 2012 MVP telling ESPN he was ` uneasy ' about returning to the franchise . Adrian Peterson has plenty to chew over but the Minnesota Vikings do not want to trade their star back . It has been a turbulent seven months for Peterson , who has been linked with the Cowboys and Cardinals . His main bone of contention is said to be with chief operating officer Kevin Warren , whom the Peterson camp claims attempted to keep him off the field last year . The Vikings start offseason workouts in a fortnight and head coach Mike Zimmer has repeatedly spoken of his desire for Peterson to stay . ` I 'm not going to speculate on what he wants or does n't want , ' Zimmer said last month . ` Adrian 's under contract for three more years with us , and that 's why you sign those contracts . That 's why you get these big bonuses , you know ? ' ` We have no plans to trade Adrian , ' he said , definitively . Peterson is under contract for 2015 , and is set to earn a base salary of $ 12.75 million from the Vikings . The Dallas Cowboys and the Arizona Cardinals are repeatedly linked as potential landing spots and when his status is settled , it will be one step nearer to finding out where his future lies .
