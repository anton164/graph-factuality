Giving away healthy lead is enough to send most managers into a fit of rage . There are many players out there that could vouch for that . On Saturday evening , NAC Breda manager Robert Maaskant let his fists do the talking as his side did just that against FC Dordrecht . After being two goals to the good at the interval thanks to goals from Dutch-Moroccan forward Adnane Tighadouini , relegation battlers NAC seemed to be heading towards three vital points against the team rooted to the bottom of the Eredivisie . NAC Breda manager Robert Maaskant takes out his anger on the substitutes bench on Saturday evening . After his side give up a two-goal lead the 46-year-old smashes through the plastic casing of the dugout . The livid NAC manager then turns to his bench to further express his dissatisfaction . However after the hour mark the home side appeared to crumble , letting the visitors claw themselves back into the game with two goals in as many minutes . Clearly incensed by his side 's lack of concentration , Maaskant turned to his bench and threw a devastating right hook to the side of the dugout . The 46-year-old clearly packs a punch because his attack sent his fist clean through the plastic casing , cutting his hand . It goes without saying we would n't want to be on the wrong end of a Maaskant rant . It 's lucky NAC 's wobble did n't occur before they headed into the changing rooms at half time ... with all those football boots lying around .
