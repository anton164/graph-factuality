On the run : Clarence Taylor , 44 , remains at large after police in Akron , Ohio ordered his arrest in connected to a bizarre ` faked kidnapping ' last fall . A man is on the run after police charged him with faking his own kidnapping in a bizarre incident last fall . Police say Clarence Taylor , 44 , faked his own kidnapping by duct taping his mouth and tying himself to a tree in Akron , Ohio . On November 1 , Taylor 's 45-year-old girlfriend called police , saying he had been missing for several days . While she was on the phone with investigators , the girlfriend received a call from another of Taylor 's friends who said he had found him tied to a tree with zip ties in a wooded area near Stoner Creek and Pickford Ave. That unidentified man then led police to Taylor , who was strangely still bound to the tree . It 's unclear why his friend did not cut him down initially . Police then released Taylor and took him to Akron General Medical Center . Taylor told police that a group of men tied him to the tree after stealing $ 2,500 from him . He says he was walking down Beechwood Drive when he saw the men with shotguns who abducted took him and took him away in their van . Taylor claimed to have been left tied to the tree for several days , despite not showing any signs of dehydration or injuries consistent with being out in the cold and rainy weather for an extended period of time . Police have since charged Taylor with a first-degree misdemeanor charge of falsification . A warrant was issued for his arrest last month but Taylor remains at large . Police have not revealed the reason for the warrant 's four month delay or a motive behind the fake kidnapping . Calls to the Akron , Ohio Police and Summit County , Ohio Sheriff 's Office were not immediately returned Monday morning .
