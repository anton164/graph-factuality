If a homeless man stopped you on the street and offered you money , what would you do ? That is the question being posed in a new YouTube video by entertainer Yousef Saleh Erakat , who disguised himself as a homeless man and found out that the answer was often less than kind . As a man in a suit and on his cell phone walks by in the beginning of the video , Erakat gets his attention . ` I just want to be a helping hand today , ' he says , offering the man a $ 10 bill . The man holds his money for a second , astounded , before throwing it at Erakat . ` I do n't need your f *** ing money , you a ****** . I could f *** ing buy you . ' YouTube entertainer Yousef Saleh Erakat disguised himself as a homeless man to see what would happen if he offered people on the street his own money instead - and found out the results were less than kind . Erakat said he wanted to ` flip the script ' . Throughout the video he appears in a beanie and a cut-off hoodie jacket , holding a cardboard sign that reads , ` No one has every become poor from giving ' Another man in a suit walks by , typing on his phone . ` I do n't have any money man , ' he says when he sees Erakat . ` No I do n't need your money , I 'm trying to give you money , ' Erakat says . When the man says he does n't need Erakat 's money the actor responds , ` I 'm just trying to help out today , here you go . ' ` Does it look like I need your money ? F *** k out of here , ' the man angrily replies , slapping his hand away before walking off . ` In today 's society it 's socially acceptable for the wealthy to give money to the homeless , ' Erakat explains in the video , posted on his fouseyTUBE channel . ` Is it acceptable because it 's one individual helping another , or because one individual is better than the other - so it 's okay to help ? ' Erakat said he wanted to ` flip the script ' . Throughout the video he appears barefoot , wearing a beanie and a cut-off hoodie jacket . He holds a cardboard sign that reads , ` No one has ever become poor from giving . ' Erakat said he wanted to find out if it was acceptable for the rich to give money to the poor because ` it 's one individual helping another , or because one individual is better than the the other - so it 's okay to help ? ' Another man tells Erakat to ` P *** off , mate , ' when he 's offered the $ 10 bill , and later a woman angrily asks him ` Are you trying to be funny ? Are you kidding me ? ' . One man stops and offers Erakat his water bottle , saying he wants to help him out but it 's all he has to give give at the moment . But when Erakat offers him money instead , he gets angry . ` You wan na give me money , man ? F **** you prick ! ' the man says as he gives the seemingly homeless man the finger and yet still taking the $ 10 bill . Erakat 's most volatile reaction comes when he offers to pay for a man 's parking meter , showing him his cardboard sign . ` Let me give you something . You see that , ' the man then asks , pointing to his white Mercedes Benz . ` That 's a Benz - you got ta earn your way up , pal . ' After Erakat tells the man that advice was the most pretentious thing he 's heard all day , the two begin yelling at each other as the man continues talking about carrying a black card and driving a $ 50,000 C-class car . ` It does n't matter how much money you have , it does n't matter what car you drive , it matters how humble you are in your heart , ' Erakat says . ` And you 're not really humble saying all that , ' he continues , to which the man just responds , ` this is LA baby ! ' When Erakat tells one man he 's does n't need money , he 's just trying to ` help out today , ' the man ` Does it look like I need your money ? F *** k out of here , ' slapping his hand away before walking off . Erakat 's most volatile reaction came when he offered to pay for a man 's parking meter , showing him his cardboard sign . ` Let me give you something . You see that , ' the man then asks , pointing to his white Mercedes Benz . ` That 's a Benz - you got ta earn your way up , pal ' Only two people featured in the video listen to the seemingly homeless man 's offer and want to give him something in return . One man hands Erakat back his $ 10 bill , adding some money of his own . ` I have all that I need too , ' the man tells him . When Erakat asks , ` you 're going to give me all that ? ' the man responds , ` it 's a good message man , so positive ' . ` I know you 're in a rush , ' Erakat says as he tries to grab the attention of one woman . When she responds that she does n't have any cash he tells her he 's actually ` trying to give you cash ' . ` No keep it , ' she says , walking towards him . ` You need it . ' ` Look I 'm broke as it is , the only way for me to feel rich in this world is by giving what I can , ' Erakat responds . ` So here you go , ' he says , reaching out to hand her the bill . Only two people featured in the video listened to the seemingly homeless man 's offer and wanted to give him something in return . ` You know what ? I have a few dollars , ' one woman told him , opening her wallet . ` Why do n't you take more and make me feel rich for the day ? Go get breakfast ! ' ` You know what ? I have a few dollars , ' she then says , opening her wallet . ` Why do n't you take more and make me feel rich for the day ? Go get breakfast ! ' Erakat gives the woman her money back before she can walk off and tells her she 's on camera . ` I 'm not trying to see who will give me money or who would not , ' he tells her . ` But I 'm just showing that the only thing they have in this world is to give to others . ' Erakat , whose YouTube channel has more than 5million subscribers , says the point of the video was n't to see ` if people would offer us money ' . Instead , the vlogger wanted to discover ` how people feel about themselves when someone who is classified as `` lesser '' than them on society 's class ladder offers them money '' . He admits in the YouTube description that the results were ` not expected and not wanted ' . ` It does n't matter how much you have in life if what you have in life takes away from you being humble , ' he writes . ` At the end of the day , even the most poor man can be the most rich depending on how much love he has in his heart .
