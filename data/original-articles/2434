Mr Mascitelli , who is studying law and commerce at university , was fined $ 500 for offensive behaviour . Appearing in Sydney 's Downing Centre Local Court on Monday to argue against the fine , Deputy Chief Magistrate Chris O'Brien told Mr Mascitelli : ` What a goose . That 's what you are . ' ` This is 8.45 in the morning and you are running through the streets with no clothes on . I do n't know why you would want a kebab at that time of day , ' he added . Mr O'Brien pointed out how children could have seen Mr Mascitelli expose himself and called his actions 'em barrassing ' . ` If people had been there with their children , or in my case my grandchildren , to see you exposing yourself ... they 're wandering off to have a swim and there you are in all your glory , ' Mr O'Brien said .
