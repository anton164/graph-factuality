Australia captain Michael Clarke believes Kevin Pietersen could play in this summer 's Ashes Test series . The 34-year-old has not played for his country since the fifth Test in Sydney , a match England lost to complete a 5-0 series defeat Down Under . Pietersen was described as ` disengaged ' from his team-mates during that final Test by England and Wales Cricket Board managing director Paul Downton . Australia captain Michael Clarke believes Kevin Pietersen could play in this summer 's Ashes Test series . Downton has since left his role and Pietersen has signed for Surrey with the intent of scoring the runs which would earn him a recall . He scored 170 against Oxford MCCU recently and Clarke feels Pietersen could represent his country again . ` I do think he could be at the Ashes , ' said Clarke . ` He has certainly scored enough runs . ` He has made it very clear he wants to play and now it will come down to the England selectors and England board making a decision . Pietersen has not featured for England since he was unceremoniously sacked 14 months ago . The former England star is hoping to win back his Test place with a return to red ball cricket . ` But at the moment from the Australians ' perspective , I 'm happy if he is not playing because he is a wonderful player . ' Clarke will link up with Pietersen in the Big Bash League after confirming he will be the captain of the Melbourne Stars next year . ` It 's going to be nice to be on the same side , ' he said . ` To have that luxury as captain - to have a player like that in your team - is extremely exciting and I know he 'll play a big part in us having success .
