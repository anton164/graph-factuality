Floyd Mayweather lacks class and does not act in the manner befitting a champion , according to Marvin Hagler . Mayweather is the richest sportsman in the world , nicknamed ` Money ' as much for his ostentatious displays of wealth as his actual bank balance . Earlier this year Mayweather posted a picture to various social media sites showing him stood in front of a fleet of super cars and a private jet . Floyd Mayweather performs at a media workout with his uncle Roger on the pads in Las Vegas . Mayweather is not shy when it comes to sharing pictures of his wealth on social media . Mayweather has posted pictures of himself counting money and of his expensive timepiece . Hagler , speaking at the Laureus Sports Awards on the 30th anniversary of his blockbuster fight with Thomas Hearns , said he is in danger of alienating fans . ` It 's not class and really no way for a champion to act , ' he said . ` If you have the skills you do n't need to impress everybody by being a show-off . Then when you get beat , the public stays behind the winner instead of with you when you were the champion . ' Hagler 's fight with Hearns is widely considered to be one of the finest bouts in history but he warned Mayweather 's Â£ $ 300million showdown with Manny Pacquiao could be a dud . The two best pound-for-pound fighters will finally meet in Las Vegas on May 2 . ` Mayweather can put you to sleep , ' Hagler added . ` Just by boxing and moving around and no excitement and Manny could be more on the defensive side rather than the offensive side so it might be boring . ' Marvin Hagler believes Mayweather lacks class and puts people to sleep with his performances .
