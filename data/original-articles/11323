Ronny Deila has admitted Celtic will enter the Champions League qualifiers minus defender Jason Denayer . The SPFL young player of the month for March , 19-year-old Denayer is wanted back at parent club Manchester City for a pre-season assessment . Keen to pursue a first-team breakthrough after making his international debut for Belgium last month , doubts over the future of Manuel Pellegrini may yet hand the Parkhead the chance of a second loan deal . Jason Denayer -LRB- left -RRB- is wanted back by Manchester City for pre-season to be assessed by their staff . But Deila admits that wo n't happen in time for the first Champions League qualifier on July 16 . ` City want Jason back for pre-season to see what kind of level he is at and where he stands and get the group together and maybe he will be loaned out again or he will stay . That is up to Jason and the manager , ' Deila explained . ` We will see what happens - but it is very hard just now . We will look for a central defender anyway , one maybe two . ' Ronny Deila confirmed that the defender would be missing for the Champions League qualifers in July . Denayer remains non-committal on the prospect of an extended loan deal and added : ` I only try to focus my mind on what is happening at Celtic and try to do my best for them . I always try to give my best level for Celtic , that 's what I need to do if I 'm to reach the highest level in football . ` I have n't spoken to Patrick Vieira or anyone at City but I hope they are happy with my progress . ` I feel that I have improved a lot from the start of the season , I 'm a more mature player and my style of play is also different from when I first arrived . ` Some of the strikers I come up against in Scotland are big and strong . They are big and a bit different to what I have been used to but I have improved with every game . ' Denayer has been an instant hit at the club and formed a formidable partnership with Virgil van Dijk .
