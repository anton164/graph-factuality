Manchester United have offered to make David de Gea the world 's best-paid goalkeeper on £ 200,000-a-week to keep him at Old Trafford . Fears are growing at United that De Gea will return to Spain and join Real Madrid on a free transfer when his contract runs out next summer . So far there has been no breakthrough in negotiations and manager Louis Van Gaal admitted yesterday that the club have made De Gea a huge offer to persuade him to stay . Manchester United have offered goalkeeper David de Gea £ 200,000-a-week to stay at the club . There has been speculation that the 24-year-old will move back to Spain to join Real Madrid this summer . ` We have offered him a lot of money , ' said Van Gaal . ` It takes a long time now . So it can always happen . I want him to stay but I am not the boss . The player is the boss , he can say yes or no . You will have to ask David De Gea not me . He has to sign . ' United 's offer of £ 180,000-a-week plus bonuses would eclipse the salaries of Manchester City 's England international Joe Hart , Gianluigi Buffon at Juventus , Bayern Munich keeper Manuel Neuer and Real Madrid 's Iker Casillas . But the feeling inside the Old Trafford dressing-room is that De Gea will leave to replace Casillas at the Bernabeu next summer , five years after joining United from Atletico Madrid for £ 17.8 m. Having overcome a difficult start in English football , the 24-year-old Spaniard has been United 's most outstanding performer this season and was nominated for PFA Player of the Year earlier this month . United would demand £ 30m if Real try to sign him this summer and Van Gaal has already prepared for the prospect of De Gea leaving as a free agent next year by bringing in former Barcelona keeper Victor Valdes . Louis van Gaal admitted , during his press conference on Friday , that De Gea has been offered ` a lot of money ' If De Gea moves to Real Madrid , it is likely he will be a replacement for Iker Casillas .
