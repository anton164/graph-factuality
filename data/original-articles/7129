The Frenchman will miss league trips to Leicester and Newcastle and the home game with Stoke but hopes to return for the visit to Arsenal on May 11 . ` Scans this week revealed a grade two hamstring strain which will keep the French international sidelined for around three to four weeks , ' said a statement on the official Swansea website . Swansea 's Bafetimbi Gomis unleashes a dangerous shot but only manages to injure his hamstring . Gomis 's injury , a grade two hamstring strain , will keep him off the pitch for three to four weeks . Gomis ' injury has come at the worst possible time as he was finding his best form in a Swansea shirt after a difficult first season at the Liberty Stadium . The 29-year-old spent the first half of the campaign in Wilfried Bony 's shadow and appeared to be agitating for a move until the Ivorian was sold to Manchester City in January for an initial Â£ 25million fee . But Gomis , who joined from Lyon on a free transfer last summer , has since settled at Swansea and had scored four goals in seven games before being injured against Everton . Loan signing Nelson Oliveira and Marvin Emnes will compete to fill Gomis ' spot at Leicester on Saturday . Gomis had scored four in his last seven matches after excelling since Wilfried Bony 's departure .
