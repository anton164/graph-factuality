Arsenal are having reservations over their interest in Raheem Sterling following the Liverpool forward 's turbulent few weeks . The Gunners are keen on the Reds forward , who is stalling on a new Â£ 100,000-per-week contract at Anfield . But it is understood the 20-year-old 's tempestuous fortnight has not gone unnoticed by members of the Emirates Stadium hierarchy . Arsenal may pull out of the running to sign Liverpool winger Raheem Sterling following recent events . Brendan Rodgers has backed his wayward star but contract stand-off has created tension at Liverpool . Sterling 's decision to hold his now infamous BBC interview without Liverpool 's permission is said to have surprised those at north London . Likewise , the fact he has been caught smoking shisha and inhaling nitrous oxide has not gone down well at Arsenal . And the FA Cup holders are now having second thoughts over their interest in the England international fearing similar scenarios could tarnish the club 's reputation . Arsene Wenger has condemned the likes of Jack Wilshere and Wojciech Szczesny over smoking incidents . England and Arsenal midfielder Wilshere -LRB- right -RRB- was involved in a smoking controversy back in February . It remains to be seen whether Arsene Wenger , who has been outspoken in his views against smoking , presses ahead with his interest in Sterling this summer . Arsenal are unlikely to be the only club in the race to land Sterling if Liverpool fail to resolve the current contract impasse . Manchester City , Manchester United and Chelsea are monitoring Sterling 's contract talks closely . Last week Real Madrid chief Zinedine Zidane admitted the Spanish giants were scouting the Liverpool star , while Bayern Munich are also interested . Real Madrid 's Zinedine Zidane has revealed his side are keen on signing England international Sterling .
