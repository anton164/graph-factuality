The New York Jets have added another former Patriot to their roster in the shape of running back Stevan Ridley . The 26-year-old has signed a one-year deal after suffering a tear to his right ACL last season . He played just six games as the Patriots won their sixth straight AFC East title and went on to win the Super Bowl . ` Sending love to all my day one fans , and every team-mate I 've had the pleasure to take the field with , ' Ridley posted on Instagram . Stevan Ridley -LRB- right -RRB- became the 15th player to join the Jets in a frantic free agency . Ridley -LRB- right -RRB- celebrates the Patriots Super Bowl win during their victory parade in Boston . ` We all know it 's a business , yet it 's also a blessing . So either way you see it , you 'll never understand . ` Love New England , Love my former team-mates and I 'm truly thankful for the opportunity the Patriots organisation has blessed me with . However it 's #ontotheJETS . ' The Jets will hope Ridley reproduces the kind of form he showed in 2012 , where he rushed for 1,263 yards and 12 touchdowns . He joins Chris Ivory and Bilal Powell at running back in a revamped Jets offense , which features fellow free agent acquisitions Brandon Marshall and Ryan Fitzpatrick . New head coach Todd Bowles has also taken Darrelle Revis back from the Patriots and Antonio Cromartie to bolster an already dominant defense . ` He 's excited for the opportunity and his rehab is going strong at this point , ' added his agent Andy Simms .
