An argument between two Brisbane neighbours over noise levels has ended in tragedy with one man dead and another charged with manslaughter . Leon Yeaman , 55 , was allegedly killed by a single punch in the head from 28-year-old shift worker Phillip Pama , 28 , during a row in front of their north Brisbane homes . Mr Yeaman was reportedly in his yard on Muller Road making a lot of noise at around 9 pm Thursday night . Phillip Pama covered his face as he left Brisbane Magistrate Courts where he was granted conditional bail on Friday . Pama , a married father of three , works a 3 am shift at a nearby warehouse and was sleeping at the time Mr Yeaman was making a commotion . Pama 's defence lawyer Bruce Peters said Mr Yeaman was known for getting drunk , playing loud music and yelling at ` the world at large ' . Pama then confronted Mr Yeaman and it was at that point the situation escalated . Mr Peters said his client grabbed his neighbour by the hand and hit out ` blindly ' . ` He was being pushed at the same time he was throwing the punch , ' Mr Peters revealed during a bail application for Pama . ` He did n't see it connect but he felt it connect . ' The father of three allegedly killed his 55-year-old neighbour with one punch after he refused to turn his music down . Paramedics were unable to revive Mr Yeaman who was pronounced dead at the scene at around 11 pm on Thursday night . Neighbours described Mr Yeaman as king and generous while his friend John Fisher told ABC Radio he was a schizophrenic pensioner who enjoyed playing loud music . Pama shielded his face from reporters outside Brisbane Magistrate Courts when he was granted bail on Friday . The Samoan man was ordered to surrender his passport , aherre to a curfew from 6 pm to 2 am and will have to report to the local police station twice a week . Pama , who has no history of violence , was reportedly ` beside himself ' with grief . The case is due to return to court on May 18 .
