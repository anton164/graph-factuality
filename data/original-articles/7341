For most people , spotting a Google Street View car is an interesting , if uneventful , point in the day . But for Nasr Bitar , it was his time to shine . The college student spotted the car on the streets of Mississauga , Canada , last autumn and began following in his own vehicle . His plan ? To get the all important ` selfie ' - and make an appearance on the Street View map . ` Time to shine ' : Nasr Bitar saw taking the perfect selfie with Google Street View as a chance to ` shine ' Tracked : It was the first time Nasr had seen a Street View car , and he followed it in his own vehicle . Having figured out the pattern the Street View car was following , Nasr parked his car , jumped out and got in position - just in time to take the snap . He told PetaPixel.com : ` I was driving home when I saw the Google car drive towards me . ` I had never seen one before , and it took me a few minutes to realize that it is Google car and it was time to shine . ' But then came the wait to see if he would make it onto the site . So , imagine Nasr 's delight when he realised Street View had been updated - and he could be seen proudly taking his selfie . Ready to go : The car clearly captured Nasr waiting to take the all-important selfie in Mississauga , Canada . Viral : The image of his selfie , and the Street View shot , has now been shared almost 2.9 million times . He then uploaded the picture to his Instagram account - where he describes himself as ` a tourist of the world ' , with the hashtag ` DontYouWishYouHadMyLife ' . It was then uploaded to image sharing website imgur , and has now been viewed almost 2.9 million times since it was posted two days ago .
