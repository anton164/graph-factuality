Jamelia has today responded to the furious backlash she is facing after saying that obese women ` should feel uncomfortable ' about their unhealthy size , and that high street stores should not be catering for them . The Loose Women panellist said she was ` hounded on Twitter ' after airing her views on the ITV show in a discussion about overweight teenagers , and now insists she was only referring to people larger than a size 20 . ` Of course I do n't think we should ban plus-size clothes from shops , ' the 34-year-old mother-of-two said on Loose Women this afternoon . ` I was referring to extreme sizing , I was referring to health and how we should all participate in helping our youngsters to live healthier lifestyles . ' Scroll down for video . The Loose Women panellist said she was ` hounded on Twitter ' after airing her views on the ITV show in a discussion about overweight teenagers , and now insists she was only referring to people larger than a size 20 . Jamelia admitted she had found the anger directed towards her following her comments ` really difficult . ' She said : ` Some of the things that have been printed I have actually said but not in that context ... It 's difficult to say your piece or to speak honestly when it kind of gets misconstrued in that way . ' Jamelia 's co-panellists were quick to leap to her defence . Ruth Langsford , 55 , stated : ` I definitely , categorically said we 're not talking about size 14 , 16 or even 18 . ' Janet Street Porter , 68 , then said : ` I was completely in agreement with Jamelia and I said you 've got to ask yourself if a young girl is already size 20-25 , can she run around with her children , can she enjoy life or is she storing up health problems for later ? ` So I do feel like Jamelia has been somewhat unfairly picked on . ' ` Of course I do n't think we should ban plus-size clothes from shops , ' the 34-year-old mother-of-two said on Loose Women this afternoon -LRB- pictured -RRB- . ` I was referring to extreme sizing ' Jamelia 's co-panellists , Ruth Langford -LRB- left -RRB- , Coleen Nolan -LRB- center left -RRB- and Janet Street Porter -LRB- right -RRB- were quick to leap to her defence .

I 'm a real woman with real opinions . I get paid to voice my opinions . Social media users weighed in on Twitter , telling Jamelia to ` keep it shut ' and accusing the singer of ` stirring up hatred ' on the topic .

I believe we are all entitled to our opinion . ` I genuinely love people and believe everyone has the right to feel wonderful and feel beautiful and it was never my intention to make people feel any less than what they are . ' Speaking on Loose Women yesterday , in the conversation which sparked the controversy , Jamelia said : ` I do not think it 's right to facilitate people living an unhealthy lifestyle , in the same way I do n't believe that a size zero should be available - it 's not a healthy size for an average woman to be . ' The star also argued that clothing should n't be sold in a size zero either , because that too is ` unhealthy ' Jamelia first response to yesterday 's Twitter backlash was a quote -LRB- pictured -RRB- . Jamelia , who also claimed she was ` all for celebrating people as they are ' , added : ` I do n't believe they -LSB- high street stores -RSB- should be providing clothes for below that range or above that range . ` Yes , have specialist shops , but you should feel uncomfortable if you are unhealthy ... to be available in every High Street store , I do n't think that 's right .
