Lewis Hamilton dominated qualifying for the Bahrain Grand Prix -- taking pole position under the lights at Sakhir by four-tenths of a second from Sebastian Vettel of Ferrari .

It 's a shame because after practice we thought the car was doing pretty well . ' Back in the garage Ron Dennis , the McLaren chairman , shrugged his hands in disappointment .
