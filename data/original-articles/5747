He told beIN Sports : ` I am very happy at Barcelona and I have not signed with anyone . ` In life , you have to be thankful . Barca are a club that changed my life , made me realise all my dreams . I 'll get to the end of my contract with the same ambition as when I came here . ' ` If the club asks me to look for another alternative , then I 'll look at the other options . But for now , this is not the case . I stay focused on the end of the season because I 'm still a competitor . A decision will be made at the end of the season .
