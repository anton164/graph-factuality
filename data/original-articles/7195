Space lasers are best known for blowing people - and planets - up in science fiction , and even the odd Bond movie . But one Scottish scientist is hoping they could , in fact , be the answer to heating our homes in the future . However , he has n't ruled out the chance of someone could potentially use them for weapons . Space lasers : Dr Adrian Quarterman has suggested space lasers could be used to power homes in the future - but says the beams will be nowhere near as powerful as imagined in films like Star Wars -LRB- pictured -RRB- . Dr Adrian Quarterman , of Dundee University , is working on a laser which will convert sun beams into energy , The Times reported . The satellites will orbit the earth , covered in mirrors to help it harvest the sunlight and convert it into laser light . The energy it then creates , using semi-conductors , can be shot back down to earth . If it works , it could mean solar power could even become viable in Scotland , or be able to restore power instantly to disaster hit areas . The physicist told The Times : ` What this will do is be able to fire at solar panels to boost the energy they are receiving . ' Initial trials in Scotland were successful , but Dr Quarterman is now hoping to move the trials to Portugal . Similar ? : Tokyo rresearchers have proposed a laser system to attach to the ISS which would be used to shoot down pieces of debris in Earth orbit -LRB- artist 's illustration shown -RRB- . Unlike the lasers in the movies , however , they will not be powerful enough to blind a pigeon , let alone blow up a planet . And it is quite different from ideas unveiled in a paper earlier this week , which could see the International Space Station fitted with lasers to clear up ` space junk ' . The system , suggested by researchers at the Riken research institute in Tokyo , would use a telescope already mounted on the station to find and target pieces of debris up to 62 miles -LRB- 100 km -RRB- away . Powerful pulses from the laser would then push space junk into Earth 's atmosphere , where it would burn up . But this laser would also not be powerful enough to be turned into a weapon : the pieces it targets will be less than a centimetre in size . However , Dr Quarterman has acknowledged you ` might possibly have to worry a bit about who is in control ' of his satellites .
