Leicester boss Richard Cockerill believes that this season 's Aviva Premiership play-off race will run until the final day of regular league season action . The Tigers tackle Saracens at Allianz Park on Saturday , separated by just two points and two places with only four games left . While Northampton are clear at the top , it is a different story for the three remaining play-off positions , with Saracens , Bath , Leicester and Exeter all bunched up behind Saints , and mid-table Wasps and Sale Sharks also can not be discounted . Leicester Tigers rugby director Richard Cockerill believes the Premiership title race will go to the wire . The 22-game Premiership campaign concludes on May 16 , with play-offs a week later , and the stakes are high . ` We 've got some tough games coming up , but we are up there in the mix , ' said Tigers rugby director Cockerill , whose team 's run-in features appointments with Saracens , London Welsh , Wasps and Northampton . ` The top four was our target at the start of the season , and that is still our target now , but we have to keep going . ` With being out of Europe , we brought our internationals straight back into the squad against Exeter -LRB- two weeks ago -RRB- because we knew they could have some down-time after that . Leicester Tigers ' Jamie Gibson -LRB- left -RRB- in action against Bath during the Aviva Premiership clash in January . ` All of the top five or six clubs have some tricky games in the run-in . We all play each other at some point , too , and it will go to the last weekend for everybody . ` This is a really big game for both teams on Saturday , with just four rounds of fixtures left in the season . ` It is a tough place to go , and Saracens are a consistently good team who come into this weekend on the back of a European Champions Cup quarter-final win . ` But we 've come into some form , and we want to maintain that through to the end of the season and see where that takes us .
