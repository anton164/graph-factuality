In the interview with Elle , Clinton does not however say too much about her mother 's campaign plans , and focuses instead on the general lack of female representation in politics . ` We 've made real progress on legal protections for women , but in no way are women at parity to men in our country in the workplace , ' she explains . ` And if we look in the political sphere , it is challenging to me that women comprising 20 percent of Congress is treated as a real success . Since when did 20 percent become the definition of equality ? ' She then adds ; ` And so when you ask about the importance of having a woman president , absolutely it 's important , for , yes , symbolic reasons -- symbols are important ; it is important who and what we choose to elevate , and to celebrate . ' Clinton , who looks almost unrecognizable in the accompanying fashion spread , also talks about life with daughter Charlotte . Clinton says that though the US is the ` land of equal opportunity , ' that is not true about gender , and a female president would change that .

And now , almost 25 years after she first hit the campaign trail as a child , Clinton seems ready to do it all over again , as the 35-year-old may once again return to the role of first daughter . Elle 's editor-in-chief Robbie Myers is certainly excited about this prospect , describing Clinton as ` innately regal ' in her editor 's letter . ` She 's a person of substance for sure , a young woman who , while measured in her manner , has a fierceness of conviction , and a calling to make the world a better place , ' says Myers . Clinton meanwhile is focused on seeing that first female president . ` Yes , we 've seen again and again , when women have been in positions of leadership , they have had different degrees of success versus their male counterparts , historically being able to build more consensus so that decisions have longer-term effects , whether in economic investments or in building social capital , ' says Clinton . ` Who sits around the table matters . And who sits at the head of the table matters , too . ' As for her mom , her big announcement is expected to come on Twitter , and from there she is off to Iowa to get to work .
