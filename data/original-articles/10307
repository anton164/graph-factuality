It 's not just humans who have a tendency to nod off in front of the TV as this comical clip shows . Sam the German Shepherd was filmed at home in Pennsylvania as he struggled to keep his eyes open while lying on the couch . Footage shows his head slowly dipping down before he suddenly wakes up and refocuses his energy on the screen . However , he keeps repeating the same action before finally giving up and pulling a big yawn . He then sleepily rolls over and snuggles up against his owner . Adding to the comedy , some smooth Jazz plays away after being dubbed over the final video edit . Going , going , gone : Sam the German Shepherd was filmed at home in Pennsylvania as he struggled to keep his eyes open while sitting on the couch . Wiped out ! Footage shows his head slowly dipping down before he suddenly wakes up and refocuses his energy on the screen .
