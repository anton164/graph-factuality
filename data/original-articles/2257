Team Sky cyclist Elia Viviani lies on the ground following a major crash in the one-day Scheldeprijs race . Sports director Servais Knaven told Team Sky 's website : ` Elia had a lot of pain in his arm and ribs , but that 's all we know at the moment . It was fortunate that none of our other riders were involved . It was a nasty crash and everything had been going well for us before it . ` Obviously , it 's a shame for Elia , but the rest of the guys are in good shape for Paris-Roubaix on Sunday . ' After the crash , Katusha 's Alexander Kristoff took the win with only 14 riders contesting the sprint .
