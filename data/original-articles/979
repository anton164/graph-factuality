Carl Froch will be a keen observer when Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr returns to the ring after a year-long absence . Froch had hoped to take on the Mexican this month in Las Vegas but a shoulder injury forced the Nottingham world champion to pull out . Instead , Chavez faces Andrzej Fonfara at a catchweight of 172 lb on Saturday night but has said he is open to facing the Brit later this year . WBA super-middleweight champion Carl Froch took part in a Poker tournament in Lenton . ` I 'm ticking over , just waiting at the moment , ' Froch told Sportsmail . ` Chavez is back in action and hopefully he 'll do the business . If he comes through unscathed and he looks impressive then there 's no reason why negotiations ca n't start for a fight with me . ` We 'll see how he looks . He might get knocked out then it would be off the table . ` We 'll take it from there and I 'll decide what I 'm going to do based on how I feel in the gym . ` It 's a fight that can be made and should be made providing we both want it . I 'm prepared to travel to America because I 'd like to fight in Las Vegas before I retire . ' Froch was due to fight Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. -LRB- right -RRB- in Las Vegas but was forced to withdraw with injury . Froch is still keen to fight in Las Vegas and would be open to travelling to America to fight Chavez .
