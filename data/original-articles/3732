We are well versed in the dangers of using sunbeds , with skin cancer preying on the minds of all who expose their skin to the UV rays . But experts have warned the disease is not the only health danger associated with the pursuit of an artificial year-round tan . Those compelled by a desire for bronzed skin are also at risk of catching a sexually transmitted infection - herpes . Dermatologist Dawn Marie Davies , from the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota , warns sunbed users could be putting themselves at risk of contracting the sexually transmitted infection , herpes . Genital herpes is highly contagious and spreads from one person to another via skin-to-skin contact . It is commonly passed on through sex and oral sex . Once a person is infected with the virus it can reactivate every so often to cause a new episode of painful genital herpes . There is no complete cure for the infection - rather , a sufferer will be given treatment each time they suffer a flare up . Dermatologist Dawn Marie Davies , an associate professor of dermatology at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota , warns the virus , and other bacteria , can survive on tanning beds , despite the heat . ` In my practice , I 've seen acquired bacterial infections , warts , and herpes infections from tanning beds , ' she told Yahoo . She said staphylococcus bacteria , which can cause skin infections , faecal bacteria , the herpes virus and the wart-causing human papillomavirus are all able to withstand the heat of a sunbed to survive . Bacteria that lies on a person 's skin can easily be transferred to the bed , when a person is lying down . The heat - not high enough to kill the infection - allows the bacteria to develop to become stronger and more able to survive . When a person sweats , it provides a breeding ground for bacteria or viruses . It is then possible for the infection to transfer to another sunbed user , entering the body via a small cut or nick in the skin , often so small a person may be unaware . ` Ultraviolet light can theoretically kill germs , but it 's not enough to kill germs on the tanning bed , ' Professor Davies warned . ` What 's interesting is that when you use the ultraviolet light over and over again - and the tanning bed lights are on for multiple hours a day - if the bacteria or virus is exposed to some antiseptic but not enough to kill it , or some light but not enough to kill it , it can grow stronger and then it becomes resistant . ' Genital herpes is highly contagious and spreads from one person to another via skin-to-skin contact . It is commonly passed on through sex and oral sex . Once a person is infected with the virus it can reactivate every so often to cause a new episode of painful genital herpes . A recurrence of the virus is often triggered by being unwell , stress , drinking excess alcohol , exposure to ultraviolet light , for example , using sunbeds , and having a weakened immune system . Herpes is highly contagious and spreads from one person to another via skin-to-skin contact . Professor Davies warns that the virus can remain on tanning beds , infecting other sunbed users . Symptoms of genital herpes include : . These symptoms may last up to 20 days , but the sores will eventually scab and heal without scarring . Although the initial symptoms of genital herpes clear up , the virus remains dormant . It can be reactivated , causing recurrences , which are usually shorter and less severe .
