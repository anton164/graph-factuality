The crew of a Turkish airlines flight are being investigated after they allowed Turkish football team captain Arda Turan into the cockpit so he could use the tannoy to congratulate his team-mates . He was celebrating after the team 's 2-1 international friendly victory against Luxembourg and had gone to the cockpit to announce his congratulations over the PA system last week . But after the move was reported in Turkish media , Turkish aviation officials in the country 's Civilian Aviation Directorate -LRB- SHGM -RRB- said it was a serious breach of the safety rules of the flight back from the capital Luxembourg City and warned that there would be consequences for the cabin crew . Turkish skipper Arda Turan is pictured inside the plane 's cockpit during the flight in breach of aviation rules after his side 's 2-1 victory in an international friendly against Luxembourg . They said that nobody other than the crew should be allowed in the cockpit during the flight and exception should be made for nobody , even the Turkish team captain and Atletico Madrid midfielder Turan . The SHGM criticised the flight crew 's decision to ignore the standard safety regulations in several tweets it posted on its official Twitter account . The first tweet noted that ` Flight teams must abide by `` Safe Cockpit '' rules for the duration of the entire flight . No one but the flight crew should be admitted to the cockpit . ' A second tweet pointed out how the pilots were in violation of the ` Safe Cockpit ' rules and are subject to a Â£ 260 fine , at the very least . The safety breach comes amid heightened concerns over aviation security after the Germanwings airliner crash in which all 150 people on board died when the plane 's co-pilot deliberately flew the Airbus jet into the ground .
