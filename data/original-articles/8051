English football is hurtling towards what promises to be a record-breaking campaign for managerial sackings . Micky Adams became the 42nd manager to be dismissed this season when he was fired on Sunday by Tranmere , rock bottom of the Football League . Forty sackings were recorded by the League Managers ' Association before the end of March , which was an all-time high , and the trend is set to smash its previous record of 46 , set in 2006-07 . Micky Adams left his role with Tranmere , who are bottom of the Football League , on Sunday . Gus Poyet is one of five Premier League manager to be sacked during this season . 2005-06 : 25 . 2006-07 : 30 . 2007-08 : 29 . 2008-09 : 28 . 2009-10 : 23 . 2010-11 : 34 . 2011-12 : 28 . 2012-13 : 36 . 2013-14 : 32 . 2014-15 : 40 . The Championship remains the most dangerous terrain . Malky Mackay , fired by Wigan this month , was the 17th to go in the second tier , where the average tenure is less than a year , thanks partly to trigger-happy clubs like Leeds . There have been 10 sackings in both League One and League Two , while the Barclays Premier League has been relatively safe , with five dismissals , not including those who quit -- Alan Pardew from Newcastle and Tony Pulis from Crystal Palace . Amid the chaos , Arsene Wenger remains the longest serving boss with more than 18 years at Arsenal , followed by Paul Tisdale , who has been at Exeter for nearly nine years , and Karl Robinson , close to five years at MK Dons . Malky Mackay became the 17th Championship manager to be sacked this season earlier in April . YEARS/MONTHS . A Wenger -LRB- Arsenal -RRB- 18/7 . P Tisdale -LRB- Exeter -RRB- 8/10 .

Robinson 's longevity at Milton Keynes is intriguing since he has resisted interest from several other clubs but he and chairman Pete Winkelman have forged a close bond . ` There were times when I could have gone and I chose to stay , ' said Robinson . ` And the chairman will tell you there were times when he could have moved me on , and had to think twice , because results have n't always been great . ` It 's increasingly difficult for managers and I 'm very fortunate with my chairman . We have an amazing relationship and I 'll always be indebted to him for this opportunity . I would have felt a bit of a fraud if I 'd walked away . ' Robinson joined MK Dons in 2007 , initially as a coach under Paul Ince . He has seen the club evolve and his team are one point from the automatic promotion places with three games to play in League One . MK Dons are at home to Doncaster tonight and fans will have an eye on Preston , one point better off , who are playing at Notts County . As other managers look longingly at Winkelman 's patience , Robinson explains how the unique nature of MK Dons has encouraged continuity at the top . ` This is a very controversial club , ' he said . ` We 're growing an identity within an industry that was reluctant to accept us and I think that is harder to achieve if you chop and change your manager .
