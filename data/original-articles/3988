Chelsea are favourites to agree terms with Brazilian starlet Kenedy after his club Fluminense agreed to sell his economic rights to Giuliano Bertolucci 's agency . Bertolucci looks after Oscar , Willian and Ramires . Another advantage for Chelsea is that the forward is represented by former Portugal international Deco , who spent two seasons playing at Stamford Bridge . Kenedy has represented Brazil at Under 17 and Under level - pictured here in January for the U20 's . Chelsea are favourites to complete the signing of the 19-year-old Brazilian starlet .

Globoesporte reported on Tuesday that a deal is being finalised with Fluminense president Peter Siemsen . The 19-year-old has been linked with the likes of Barcelona , Manchester United and Juventus but the Blues look likely to win the race for his signature .
