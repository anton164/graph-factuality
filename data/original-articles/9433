Russian media reported that Mr Lunev was taken to hospital in Novoazovsk near the Russian border , where he later regained consciousness . The incident took place in the wake of several exchanges of fire overnight and in the early hours on the outskirts of the rebel stronghold of Donetsk , despite an agreement reached by the Ukrainian and Russian foreign ministers a day earlier . The yearlong military conflict between Russian-backed rebels and Kiev government forces has claimed more than 6,000 lives and left large parts of Ukraine 's once industrial heartland in ruins .

Fighting in the east had largely subsided following a cease-fire deal signed in February but has rekindled in recent days . Recovering : Reporter Mr Lunev was taken to hospital where he later regained consciousness . Heavy shelling was heard in Donetsk , eastern Ukraine , late Monday evening and in the early hours on Tuesday . Ukrainian military spokesman Andriy Lysenko told a televised briefing that six troops were killed and 12 wounded in a 24-hour period , while rebels reported one fighter dead and five wounded in the overnight clashes . The death toll is the highest since the February cease-fire was signed . Lysenko also reported civilian casualties , including two teenagers who were wounded in shelling in the Horlivka area , north of Donetsk . Russia and Ukraine agreed in Berlin on Monday to call for the pullback of smaller-caliber weapons from the front lines of the conflict that has claimed more than 6,000 lives . On the ground , however , even the previous agreement that called for a cease-fire and a withdrawal of large-caliber weaponry appeared to be shaky . The U.S. State Department supports the steps taken in Berlin , spokeswoman Marie Harf said Tuesday , but she also voiced concern about the ongoing fighting . ` The Russian-backed separatists continue to take aggressive action in Ukraine , ' she said . ` And the Russian-backed separatists continue to stall Minsk implementation .
