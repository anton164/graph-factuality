A healthcare worker who recently returned from West Africa has been taken to a hospital after displaying symptoms which could be the deadly Ebola virus . The unnamed woman has been placed in an isolation ward at Canberra Hospital for treatment on Friday with doctors and nurses wearing full protective clothing . The woman did not treat any cases of the deadly virus where she worked at an Ebola treatment clinic in Liberia before she arrived in Australia on April 5 . The woman is being treated in complete isolation with doctors and nurses wearing full protective clothing . Health officials say it 's most unlikely she has Ebola and her symptoms - a fever and stomach upset - are consistent with many other conditions . She 's being treated in complete isolation in a single room under the hospital 's Ebola protocol . Chief medical administrator for ACT Health professor Frank Bowden said this was a precautionary measure with strict protocols to protect the patient , staff and the community . ` We believe that this patient has an extremely low risk of having Ebola , ' he told reporters . The woman developed symptoms which could be the deadly Ebola disease after returning from West Africa . The unnamed health worker is in isolation at Canberra Hospital where she is being treated for Ebola . Professor Bowden said it would be 72 hours before her diagnosis was definitely known . He said the community should not be alarmed . ` We are taking every precaution , ' he said . ` Here where the patient has an extremely low risk of Ebola , we know there is no risk to the public of Ebola . ' Dr Andrew Pengilley , acting ACT chief health officer , said this could be a normal stomach bug , malaria or a viral illness which affected people in West Africa as they did in Australia . ` Ebola is not a particularly transmissible infection under normal circumstances . It 's transmitted by direct contact with bodily fluids so we are confident there is no risk to the wider community , ' he said .
