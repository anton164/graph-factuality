An FBI agent 's sniper rifle -LRB- similar to the one pictured -RRB- was ripped out of his car 's window and stolen from a Salt Lake City hotel parking lot . An FBI agent 's sniper rifle was ripped out of his car 's window and stolen from a Salt Lake City hotel parking lot just days before President Obama visited Utah earlier this month . The gun was inside a hard rifle case and was ` secured properly ' to a truck safe with padlocks and chains while the car was parked at the Marriott Springhill Suites , according to police . Police believe the thief stole the rifle by breaking the rear right passenger-side window , tying a rope around the rifle case 's handle or a cable lock , and using the momentum from another vehicle to then break the case 's handle free from the lock . The window frame of the agent 's car was pulled from the door , which police believe could indicate the large case was ripped through the shattered window . ` The rifle had been secured properly , ' Salt Lake City Police Detective Dennis McGowan told Fox 13 Salt Lake City . ` There are all kinds of ways the weapon was secure . Yet someone was able to forcefully take the weapon . ' The FBI agent also reported that his gear bag , backpack , and some clothing and tools were also stolen during the March 27 theft , which the police report states happened overnight . The theft happened just a week before Obama -LRB- pictured during his visit -RRB- made a scheduled trip to Utah earlier this month . Officers found two skid marks and pieces of rope lying on the pavement near the car , as well as the broken-off handle of the rifle case . The agent 's bags and some of his clothing were found at a Residence Inn across the street , but the sniper rifle has not been recovered . Marriott Springhill Suites , the agent 's hotel , is next to the city 's airport and just down the street from the state 's FBI office . The hotel does not have surveillance cameras , according to the police report . Salt Lake City police said the rifle 's serial number has been entered into the National Crime Information Computer . The Secret Service told Fox 13 Salt Lake City the agency was notified about the stolen rifle before President Obama 's visit , but could not comment if the theft prompted an increase of security . Det. McGowan said police do not know if the thief specifically targeted the agent 's car . The sniper rifle was stolen sometime overnight from the parking lot of Marriott Springhill Suites , where the agent was staying . The hotel is just across the street from the state 's FBI office .
