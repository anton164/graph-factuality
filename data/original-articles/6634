Hog 's Breath Cafe Australian general manager Ross Worth said he had taken immediate action to make sure an instance like this will never happen again . ` We have moved to ensure every plug has been chained to the sink , ' he told News Limited . He said the plug in question was from a sanitised ice bath that is used to wash lettuce and tomatoes . While social media users may have taken the incident lightly , Mr Worth said he had taken the issue ` very seriously ' . ` We alerted the health department and have had them go in and check everything is up to scratch there , which of course it is . ' Mr Worth said he reached out and apologised to the woman who was served the unusual side .
