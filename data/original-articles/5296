Footage shows exotic pet owner Kayonna Cole holding her female rose hair spider up to the camera as it digs its fangs into her skin . Kayonna , who filmed the moment at her home in Los Angeles , remains calm throughout the video , but later suffered a reaction to the spider 's venom . Kayonna holds her hand steady and remains calm as the tarantula removes its fangs from her skin . Clearly visible are the tarantula 's fangs , which it immediately begins to use to pinch away at Kayonna 's hand . Unflinching , Kayonna holds her hand steady as the tarantula removes its fangs from her skin and tucks them in slightly . Later in the video the spider begins pinching her once more and even appears to puncture the surface of her skin . Kayonna bravely holds her female rose hair spider up to the camera while it demonstrates its biting action . But once again the spider 's owner remains remarkably calm and holds her hand still for the spider . Kayonna wrote online that the tarantula was showing aggression or possibly testing her fangs . She wrote : ` Her bites were not painful , the after effects from the venom were more painful with the symptoms being slight redness of the skin surrounding the bites , soreness and itching . ` This species of tarantula has low toxicity venom similar to that of a bee sting .
