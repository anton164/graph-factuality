Chairman of the Hampshire Police Federation burst out laughing when he saw the uniform and posted a photograph of it online . John Apter said : ` I saw an officer wearing the uniform during a training day at the Hampshire Constabulary headquarters . ` I initially thought the uniform was inside out . I then spoke to an another officer who said he was given one which was exactly the same . ` It was an error by the manufacturing company but it is funny that some of the officers have to decided to wear them . ` It boosts morale within the force because it 's funny to see . Three officers were given them and I heard one of them sent it back to the manufacturing firm . Who knows , they could be worth some money in the future . ' Mr Apter said the officers will only wear the uniforms ` internally ' and not when they are patrolling the area . He added : ` It makes people simile and I 'm sure the uniforms will inject a bit of morale into the police force . Although it is an unfortunate error , hopefully people can see the funny side of it .
