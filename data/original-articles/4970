The mother of a three-year-old boy who was killed when a runaway two-tonne trailer mounted the pavement and crushed him to death is being targeted by online trolls who blame her for the incident . Donna Hussey , 32 , has also been branded a ` bad mum ' by trolls on Facebook over the death of her son Freddie - who was killed when a huge portable cabin came loose from a passing Land Rover . Mrs Hussey , who had just dropped her eight-year-old son Archie to school , was helpless as the runaway trailer mounted the pavement and crushed young Freddie against a wall in Bedminster , Bristol . Donna Hussey , 32 -LRB- right -RRB- , has been targeted on Facebook and branded a ` bad mum ' by trolls who blame her for the death of her son Freddie -LRB- left -RRB- - who was killed when a runaway trailer crushed him against a wall . A passing lorry driver tried to resuscitate Freddie and paramedics arrived within minutes , but he died shortly afterwards at Bristol Children 's Hospital . Police investigators found the trailer had not been correctly attached to the Land Rover but driver Tony Davies avoided prison after admitting causing death by careless driving . His sentence infuriated Mrs Hussey and Freddie 's father Scott , 37 , who blasted his punishment of a six-month driving ban and 200 hours of community service as a ` joke ' . Mrs Hussey said her torment has now been worsened further by hateful Facebook trolls who have bombarded her with messages calling her a ` bad mum ' since the tragedy in January last year . The insurance worker said : ` Something that has been difficult was the reports that Freddie was behind me -LRB- when it happened -RRB- and that was not true . ` I 've had lots of hurtful comments and people Facebooking me , sending abusive messages that I was a bad mum . ` I see little kids a few steps in front or behind their parents every day . ` I have to live with what happened . ` I loved that little boy and I love Archie so much . Those kids were my world and I just never would have put them in harm 's way . ` I just want people , before they start making nasty comments , to really think about how they are with their children and how they feel it is right to judge . ` It has been very hurtful and we have already gone through hell . ' Freddie -LRB- left -RRB- died after being hit by a trailer which cameoff a Land Rover driven by Tony Davies -LRB- pictured outside court last week , right -RRB- . Davies , 38 , was spared jail after admitting causing death by careless driving . A trailer used as a workmen 's cabin came off Davies ' Land Rover and crushed Freddie to death against a wall . This is the trailer coupling which failed , allowing the trailer cabin to detach from the Land Rover in Bristol . Bristol Crown Court heard last week how the tow hitch between the Land Rover and the trailer was not secure because the position of its handbrake prevented it from being locked down . Prosecutor Anna Vigars said Freddie had been walking behind his mother , playing in the puddles and laughing and joking when the accident happened . They had just dropped off his brother at Parson Street Primary School when the portable cabin detached , travelling around 10 or 12 car lengths before mounting the pavement and crushing the toddler against a wall and telegraph pole . The trailer is used on building sites as an area for workers to relax and contained a kitchen area with a table and basic facilities , as well as a toilet . Davies , 38 , was spared jail after admitting causing death by careless driving but Freddie 's family slammed the ` lenient ' sentence and have started a petition to get mandatory safety checks for towing equipment . When Judge Geoffrey Mercer QC handed Davies his sentence , Mr Hussey branded him a ` f ****** joke ' and called Davies a ` f ****** t *** ' . Mrs Hussey agreed , calling the sentence ` disgusting , no justice at all ' before shouting at Davies : ` I hope you rot in hell . You are scum . He was a beautiful little boy . ' Mr Hussey revealed how he has suffered panic attacks since the tragedy and lost his HGV driving job because he can not get behind the wheel . Freddie 's parents Scott and Donna Hussey denounced the sentence of a six-month driving ban and 200 hours of community service given to Davies as a ` f ****** joke ' . They have set up a petition calling for tougher rules . Mrs Hussey -LRB- pictured left with her husband Scott -RRB- said she has received ` lots of hurtful messages ' over the death of Freddie -LRB- right -RRB- who was killed in by the runaway trailer in Bedminster , Bristol in January last year . He said : ` If the law can change then that would be great it is not all for nothing , but we also want to get the sentence changed . ` We feel we have been wronged by the justice system . ` We thought we would get justice but we are back at day one again . It is hard and it feels the past 14 months have been for nothing . ' His wife added : ` Since the sentencing we feel we are back at day one again , we do n't want to get out of bed and carry on . ` We feel like we lost our little boy for nothing . ` He was giggling at me and then out of nowhere the trailer came , it all happened so fast . I could n't get to him in time and these moments will live with me forever . ` I saw things no one should ever see . I know we did nothing wrong but still go over what ifs . ' In a moving statement , she earlier described the impact on her family of Freddie 's death , and said : ` We have all suffered with nightmares and flashbacks and we have had to put Archie to bed most nights crying as he is missing his little brother , his best friend and playmate and can not comprehend how or why this has happened . ` Archie does n't want to watch cartoons on Saturday morning any more , as this is something he used to do with Freddie . ` It is devastating as a parent when you have already lost one child and your other one talks about killing himself so he can be with his brother . He is only eight years old . What can you do or say ? ` Archie and I have started therapy . I get flashbacks of the incident and events before and after every day . I have woken up at night screaming as I relive what happened in my dreams and it is terrifying . '
