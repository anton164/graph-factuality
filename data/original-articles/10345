British No 2 Aljaz Bedene has booked a quarter-final place at the Grand Prix Hassan II event in Casablanca . The world No 99 , who switched allegiance from Slovenia to Britain last month , knocked out fellow qualifier Arthur De Greef , of Belgium , 6-2 , 6-3 in just 70 minutes . London-based Bedene , 25 , will now face third seed Jiri Vesely , who was given a far tougher test as he progressed to the last-eight . British number two Aljaz Bedene , pictured in June 2013 , defeated Arthur De Greef in just 70 minutes . Bedene represents Great Britain after switching allegiance from Slovenia in March . Czech Vesely claimed his first victory of the year on clay , but only after saving a set-point against former world top-10 player Mikhail Youzhny to progress 7-6 -LRB- 9/7 -RRB- , 6-3 . Top seed and defending champion Guillermo Garcia-Lopez , though , suffered a surprise defeat , bowing out 6-3 , 6-3 against Morocco 's world number 313 and wild card entry Lamine Ouahab . Ouahab next faces Spaniard Daniel Gimeno-Traver , who held a 6-1 , 4-1 lead against seventh seed Mikhail Kukushkin , before he was forced to retire .
