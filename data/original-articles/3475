Jurgen Klopp rejected the overtures of West Ham United after handing in his notice at Borussia Dortmund . No matter , it was worth a try . Now on to the next one . If Rafael Benitez wants to return to English football after leaving Napoli maybe he can be persuaded to take over a project that includes a move to the iconic Olympic Stadium in a year 's time . West Ham need a coach of high ambition to underline the size of the venture . Sam Allardyce is n't that man . He had his chance and did not take it . Allardyce has often talked of the qualities he could bring to an elite club , but the momentum of his season changed on Boxing Day when he left his best players out of the starting line-up at Chelsea , and lost . Sam Allardyce is not the man to lead West Ham into their new exciting adventure at the Olympic Stadium . Allardyce -LRB- left , pictured behind Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini -RRB- has not been up to scratch .

The folly of resting key individuals for such an important game over the Christmas period was exposed as West Ham then played two home fixtures , losing to Arsenal and drawing with West Brom . If West Ham had maintained their form going into the Chelsea game -- 31 points from 17 matches -- they would now be fifth in the league . Had their form since that day been played out through the season -- 12 points from 16 games -- they would be bottom . Allardyce 's reputation is that of a man who guarantees survival , but since Christmas West Ham have been playing relegation football . If a new manager is being considered , it is understandable . West Ham must go to the Olympic Stadium with more on their minds than survival . Rafael Benitez could return to English football after Napoli and may be persuaded by the Hammers project .
