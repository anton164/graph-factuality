Think you 've got a good memory ? Think again . Drawing a world map from scratch would already be considered a difficult feat , let alone taking on the near-impossible task of doing it from memory . Yet , images have gone viral of a New Yorker accomplishing exactly that , and it just so happens that it 's an 11-year-old boy . The 11-year-old boy with autism is seen drawing the intricate map of the world from scratch . A professor in New York invited her 11-year-old autistic son to one of her classes , during which he got up on a chair and drew the world map from memory . A student took the photos and her father posted them on the online community , Reddit , as user Bobitis . Bobitis explained : ` He is the son of one of my daughter 's professors . He came into the classroom today and did this . ' In the images , the youth is seen kneeling on a chair in order to reach the whiteboard , with his pen held to the extremely detailed map . The world map was highly accurate and even included details such as political borders and tiny coastal islands . Not only is the map accurate , with some major countries labelled , but the high level of detail extends to the inclusion of political borders and even tiny coastal islands . Reddit user Bobitis further commented : ` I just was amazed ... especially as a father of a child with similar attributes ... that 's all ... ' Autism is a complex disability , and while some individuals can have specific difficulties with memory , others can also have exceptional memory and visual skills .
