A mother was horrified to find a dead gecko stuck to the lining of a jacket she bought from Asda . Paula Dunican spent £ 25 on the baby blue coat at her local branch in Canterbury , Kent . But when the 49-year-old took it home to try on , she noticed a dark stain ` seeping through ' from the its lining . Inside , a four inch-long gecko was flattened , its scales imprinted onto the fabric . Paula Dunican was horrified when she found the body of a crushed lizard on the lining of a £ 25 coat from Asda . ` I noticed the coat had a stain on the back seeping through , so I opened it and stuck to the lining was a shrivelled , squashed lizard , ' said Mrs Dunican . ` I think it must have been ironed - it was disgusting . ' The supermarket has offered her a refund and £ 40 voucher , adding that the reptile may have climbed into one of the boxes transporting clothes from Vietnam where they are made . Its quality control department said it was waiting for Mrs Dunican , who is a school learning support assistant , to return the garment . In 2012 another Asda customer found a dead cockroach inside a kettle she had bought to sterilise baby items . Mrs Dunican said the reptile looked as though it had been ironed onto the coat . A spokesman for Asda apologised and offered her a £ 40 voucher and refund . Carly Wintle bought the own brand appliance in Weston-Super-Mare , Somerset , and found the insect inside after unwrapping it . Meanwhile in February a disgusted shopper found the severed head of a frozen rat in a bag of frozen spinach . Terri Powis , 33 , was horrified when she opened the bag and found the rodent 's decomposing body . The supermarket apologised and asked her to return the item to the store , acting , she said , as though it happened ` every day ' , the Mirror reported .
