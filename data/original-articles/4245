' Crave comfort : Robb & Lulu have found women like seeing models who are comfortable in their own skin . Leading the way in size range too , Robb & Lulu have chosen to make resort wear that goes from size 0 up to 26 and swimwear that includes bigger cup sizes too , with cups sizes going up to a double F. ` Lulu found there was a gap in market and she needed to design for women that are bigger and bustier and people that were able to feel empowered and comfortable in a bigger bikini or kaftan . ' And the proof is in the demand , with British Vogue already catching wind of the label 's range and requesting stock from them based on their fits and ability to suit all bodies and sizes . Australian designer Manning Cartell have also taken a stance , with all 39 women on their runway being size 8-10 models this season .
