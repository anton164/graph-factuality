Jordan Henderson is not ready to give up on Liverpool 's Champions League hopes despite an eight-point gap to Manchester United in fourth place . The 24-year-old scored a penalty at the Emirates on Saturday , but it was not enough as Liverpool fell to a 4-1 thrashing at the hands of Arsenal to leave their top-four hopes in tatters . That result followed a devastating 2-1 home defeat by Manchester United last time out and Brendan Rodgers ' side have fallen from two points off Champions League qualification to eight behind . Jordan Henderson urged Liverpool not to give up on their hopes of finishing in the top four . Henderson is targeting seven wins out of seven in the league and an immediate response at Blackburn . But Henderson urged his team not to give up on the top-four race with seven games to play , and to bounce back immediately on Wednesday night when they take on Blackburn in an FA Cup quarter-final replay . He told Liverpool 's official website : ` We knew it was going to be difficult -LSB- to finish in the top four -RSB- , even before Saturday , but it makes it even more difficult . ` That does n't mean we 'll just give up . We 've got seven games left now and we need to try to win every one . If we do that , then you never know . ` Blackburn is another big game for us straight away . We 've got to recover well , learn from this one and move on and try to get a big win on Wednesday . '
