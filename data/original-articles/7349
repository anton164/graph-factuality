Sheffield Wednesday are ready to offer new contracts to defender Tom Lees and goalkeeper Keiren Westwood . Wednesday equalled their club record of 17 clean sheets in a season on Tuesday night with a 1-0 win over promotion-chasing Brentford . The record has stood since 1978-79 in the days when Jack Charlton was manager . Tom Lees -LRB- right -RRB- is in line to offered a new deal at Sheffield Wednesday after impressing since joining the club . Lees , who joined last summer from Leeds , has been a key figure and like Westwood is among the contenders for the club 's Player of the Year award . He said : ` It would have been a long summer had we not got that clean sheet to equal the club record . It would have been so frustrating because we 've had so many games to get that one clean sheet . ' With three games remaining , naturally , the defender is hoping to go one better . He added : ` Now it would be nice to set a new record . That is our target so we 'll have to see how it goes . The boys who have come in to the back four have done well . ` Our problem recently has been that we have n't taken our chances , kept clean sheets and seen out games but we did all that against Brentford . ' Along with Lees , goalkeeper Kieren Westwood is among the contenders for the club 's Player of the Year award .
