If Bayern Munich manage to overturn the 3-1 Champions League quarter-final first leg scoreline handed to them by Porto last week , Xabi Alonso will have his eyes on a very special record . Should Pep Guardiola 's side go all the way and claim this season 's title as European champions , Alonso will become only the second player to win European football 's top trophy with three clubs having held it during his time at Liverpool and Real Madrid . The only other player to have done so is AC Milan legend Clarence Seedorf , who lifted the famous piece of silverware for Ajax , Real Madrid and Milan . Xabi Alonso could become only the second player to win the Champions League with three different teams . Alonso in action during Bayern Munich 's 3-1 Champions League quarter-final defeat against Porto last week . It is quite an achievement , and one that the Spanish maestro recently admitted to thinking about . ` There is one player who has won three Champions Leagues with three different clubs : -LSB- Clarence -RSB- Seedorf . Of course it is in my mind . The end of my career is near , ' Alonso told The Telegraph . ` I do n't have many years left but it is one of the targets . It is an individual target and it would be great to win the third one with a third club because the Champions League is special , ' he added . Alonso won the Champions League in his first season at Liverpool when he scored the decisive equaliser in 2005 . And last season he was part of Carlo Ancelotti 's side to take the title , even though his yellow cards throughout the tournament meant he was forced to sit in the stands for the final win over Atletico Madrid . Alonso celebrates winning Europe 's top club prize in his first season with Liverpool in 2005 . Alonso -LRB- on the ground -RRB- scored the equaliser for Liverpool during the 3-3 against AC Milan before the English club won 3-2 on penalties .

Seedorf won the title a total of four times in his illustrious career - in 1995 with Ajax , 1998 with Madrid and twice with Milan , in 2003 and 2007 . At 33 and with a club as strong as Bayern on a two-year deal under Pep Guardiola , Alonso could even attempt to match Seedorf 's total achievement . Thiago Motta could also equal Seedorf 's record if he manages to earn a Champions League medal with Paris Saint-Germain , but the 32-year-old midfielder has his work cut-out as the Ligue 1 side trail to a 3-1 aggregate scoreline against Barcelona . Names to have retired with two Champions League medals while at two different teams include the likes of Deco with Porto -LRB- 2004 -RRB- and Barcelona -LRB- 2006 -RRB- and former Manchester United goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar who had been part of the 1995 Ajax squad before holding the trophy once again with the Red Devils . Midfielder Thiago Motta could would equal Seedorf 's record if he were to win the Champions League with PSG . The Spaniard was suspended for Real Madrid 's Champions League final victory against Atletico last year . Clarence Seedorf -LRB- centre -RRB- won four Champions League with three clubs , including two with AC Milan . The Dutch midfielder celebrates with the famous trophy after Madrid 's victory against Juventus in 1998 .
