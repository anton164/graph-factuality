They say you should never forget your roots . Even more so in the case of this striking tree spotted in southern China . The banyan tree in Guangxi province does not stand on a single trunk , but a whole web of roots . It has captured the attention of locals , who say they have watched the whole thing sway in the wind due to its flimsy structure , reported the People 's Daily Online . Scroll down for video . Fairy tale : The Banyan looks like enchanted trees found in children 's books . Uprooted : The original tree roots grew up against a wall , before it was moved to a nearby park . Originally the roots of the tree grew up against a wall , but when the wall was demolished the tree was carefully uprooted to its new location Northern Gulf Marine and Cultural Park in Fangchenggang city . The roots then became the trunk of the tree , leading to its strange appearance . These photos show how the entangled trunks look like something straight out of the Enchanted Forest . It is truly remarkable that the web of overlapping roots can support the weight of the tree above . Banyan trees are found in hot climates and known for their extensive roots . Sometimes the roots grow so out of control that they eventually engulf the tree and kill it .
