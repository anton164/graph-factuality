Steven Abberley caused a major security alert by throwing marbles at MPs and shouting ` you are all just liars ' during Prime Minister 's Questions . A protester who caused a major security alert by throwing marbles at MPs and shouting ` you are all just liars ' during Prime Minister 's Questions has walked free from court . Steven Abberley , 28 , hurled a tirade of abuse at politicians during a session in the House of Commons in October last year . He then threw the glass balls from the public gallery , but they missed MPs and hit a security screen . Abberley excused himself to fellow observers before shouting ` you are all just liars ' at Prime Minister David Cameron and the rest of the chamber during the televised Parliamentary debate . When arrested , Abberley told police officers that he had daubed the words ` the enemy within ' in red paint on the palace 's walls , Westminster Magistrates ' Court was told . Prosecutor Mavis Ramkissoon said the incident happened five minutes before the end of the weekly question-and-answer session . She said : ` Without warning at 12.25 pm , Mr Abberley stood up and began to shout , `` I 'm sorry about this ladies and gentlemen '' . ` Mr Abberley 's arms were outstretched , he said : `` you f *** ing w ***** s , you are just liars '' . ' Abberley , who is unemployed , then interjected from the dock , telling the court : ` Can I just say for the record I did n't call anyone `` f *** ing w ***** s '' . I called them `` dishonourable b ****** s '' . ' Ms Ramkissoon continued : ` He produced a cloth bag and threw the contents of the bag at the security screen , causing a loud bang . ' The prosecutor said there was no damage to the screen , but the marbles scattered causing ` distress and shock ' to the people in the gallery . ` When he was arrested , Abberley made admissions to the arresting officer concerning criminal damage to the Palace of Westminster ' , she said . Abberley had scrawled the words ` the enemy within ' on the wall just outside the public gallery .

There is no footage of Abberley spray painting the wall , and the judge said he would not have been caught if he had not told the police what he had done . Ms Ramkissoon said it cost £ 2,416 to remove the graffiti . The court heard that Abberley , whose mother was in court today , is taking medication for mental health and a behavioural disorder . He said that he is looking for a job , and is hoping to join the Army . Abberley , from Carshalton , south London , admitted one count of criminal damage and one of threatening behaviour . District Judge Quentin Purdy sentenced him to eight weeks in prison for throwing the marbles and four weeks for the graffiti , but suspended both jail terms . ` Your personal view of politicians , whatever they may be , are entirely a matter for you , ' he said . The unemployed 28-year-old was given suspended sentences for criminal damage and threatening behaviour . ` But the difficult you have is how you chose to express it , by criminal damage and your antics in the gallery at the House of Commons . ` People are entitled to go to that place and listen calmly to that said below . You chose to disrupt them . ' The judge said Abberley had caused ` disquiet ' which may force others to think again about attending Parliament . ` Those that cause disruption at the Palace of Westminster have a knock-on effect to other freedoms and confidence in going that , and that must be actively deterred . ' The sentences will run concurrently and Abberley has been ordered to pay back £ 500 in compensation at a rate of £ 5 a fortnight . He will also undergo supervision sessions for two years , mental health treatment for the next year , and pay an £ 80 victim surcharge .
