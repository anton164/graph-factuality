Swansea City have revived their interest in Blackburn Rovers striker Rudy Gestede . Manager Garry Monk has made a striker his priority for the summer and club scouts have checked on Aleksandar Mitrovic at Anderlecht and Obbi Oulare from Club Brugge . An offer has been made to Marseille 's Andre Ayew also but he remains a target for bigger clubs too . Gestede has scored 20 goals this season and Blackburn value him at £ 7million . Swansea are interested in signing Blackburn 's Benin international forward Rudy Gestede -LRB- centre -RRB- . The striker is rated at £ 7million by Rovers , as Swansea set their sights on signing a proven hitman . Anderlecht hitman Aleksandar Mitrovic has also caught Swansea 's eye and they could move for him too . Club Brugge striker Obbi Oulare has been attracting plenty of interest from the Premier League recently . Crystal Palace , Hull and West Brom have all made enquiries but considered the 6ft 4ins Benin international overpriced . Blackburn face a dilemma this summer as they contend with Financial Fairplay restrictions with Middlesbrough , Derby and Nottingham Forest ready to bid for Jordan Rhodes too . They want to gain promotion but need to sell to balance the books . Swansea are also keen to sign a left-back with Leicester 's Jeffrey Schlupp among the players being considered . Marseille 's French-Ghanian forward Andrew Ayew is another player on Swans ' summer wish-list . Leicester City left-back Jeffrey Schlupp -LRB- right -RRB- has also attracted interest from the Swans .
