Vincent Kompany has revealed that his mum halted a move allowing him to join Manchester United when he was just 17-years-old . The Manchester City captain and winner of two Premier League titles at the Etihad Stadium , was the subject of an inquiry from Sir Alex Ferguson when he was breaking through the ranks at Anderlecht . But Kompany admits that his mother insisted he finishes school before to England , and he says ` everything has played out perfectly ' after he eventually sealed a switch to the Premier League in 2008 . Vincent Kompany -LRB- centre -RRB- says his mum stopped him moving to Manchester United as a teenager . The Belgian international broke into Anderlecht 's first team at a young age and was highly-coveted . He told the Daily Mirror : ` United asked about me , but I had other priorities at the time . I was studying for my A-levels and my mother made me finish my education before I could concentrate on football . ` It 's a massive honour to be captain of this club and I can tell you that I feel really good . I have put my sweat and blood into Manchester City . I 'm passionate about the club and I want success as much as the owners . ' Old Trafford welcomes City on Sunday when they face rivals United , and Kompany has insisted his team-mates to produce a high-quality performance as they bid to win a fifth consecutive derby . ` When I started playing for City , these games were 90-10 in United 's favour . We knew every time we went to Old Trafford that history was n't good for us there . ` It 's different now . This game is about two big clubs facing each other . It 's almost 50-50 -- and we all know what this game means . ' Sir Alex Ferguson attempted to bring 17-year-old Kompany to Old Trafford but the move did n't materialise .
