Hailed as one of the most imaginative minds in history , Dr Seuss created magical worlds with playful rhymes and kooky illustrations . But it seems his words have come to life somewhere in the depths of Alaska . This towering structure 130 miles from Anchorage was once a two-story home , built after a forest fire swept the valley clean of trees . Dr Seuss fans flock to Alaska to visit this 12-cabin-high structure that looks like one of his illustrations . Teetering : The owner wanted to be able to see the idyllic valley over the tall trees around their cabin . In need of renovation : It was abandoned for years but new owners are now renovating it . Eclectic : The storys are bound together with metal sticks and unusual platforms . It seemed unfathomable to Dr Seuss fans that a real life version of this tower could be created . However , when the trees eventually started shooting up again , the owner refused to relinquish his idyllic view of the mountains . So they built up . And up . And up . Now it teeters at an impressive 12 storys high , bearing a stark resemblance to the kind of houses drawn in Dr Seuss 's books . Stands out : The house is miles from any other home , about 130 miles from the center of Anchorage . ` We made it ! ' : These are just two of the hundreds of Instagram posts taken by fans outside the property . Birds-eye view : Alaska Aerial Media captured the unusual tower in all its glory after a heavy bout of snow . And it has not gone unnoticed . Hordes of Dr Seuss fans have flocked to ` climb the tower ' in the past few years . According to This Is Colossal , the house was eventually abandoned by the imaginative architect . The site notes , however , that new owners are now renovating the property to withstand the heavy winds .
