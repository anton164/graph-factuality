The Tories said size of the union donations to Labour exposed the type of Government Mr Miliband would lead as Prime Minister .

Nick Clegg , pictured in Talgarth , Brecon , Wales today , received just £ 50,000 over seven days - while Ukip took just £ 8,000 , according to figures from the Electoral Commission . MP Bob Neill said : ` Ed Miliband has taken another hefty wedge of cash from the union barons , which comes with strings attached . ` More spending , more borrowing , higher taxes and a bigger welfare bill - all demands that he will bow to in exchange for their financial support . ` Ed Miliband wants to sneak into Downing Street by the back door - funded by Len McCluskey 's union cash and propped up by Nicola Sturgeon 's SNP . They will call the tune and the British people will pay the price . ' By law , political parties must submit weekly donation and loan reports to the commission if they are standing candidates in the UK parliamentary election and they have received any donations or loans over £ 7,500 . Parties must notify the commission if they are not standing candidates in order to be exempt from weekly reporting .
