This is the comical moment a delirious wisdom tooth patient refuses milkshake in fear that it could - in singer Kelis ' words - ` bring all the boys to her yard ' . Faith Myers , 14 , from Nebraska , was filmed by her mother as she woke in bed still ` high ' from the procedure 's anesthesia . Footage shows her being quizzed about what she would like to eat , with the thought of a shake clearly filling her with dread . ` I do n't want all the boys in my yard , ' she immediately chimes through a mouthful of blood-stained tissues . ` You do n't want any boys in your yard ? Will your milkshake bring all the boys to the yard ? ' her amused mother responds . ` Yeah , I do n't want them here , ' Faith confirms with a look of fear on her face . The teen 's mood then takes a more sinister turn as she declares that she will ` bring out a shotgun ' if any boys come into her yard . ` Bang , bang ! ' she exclaims , with a look of glee in her eyes . Caught on camera : Faith Myers , 14 , from Nebraska , was filmed by her mother as she woke in bed still high from the procedure 's anesthesia .
