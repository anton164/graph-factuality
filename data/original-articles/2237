Manchester City are planning to table a mega-bid for Raheem Sterling on the day the transfer window reopens . The reigning Barclays Premier League champions have made the Liverpool forward a primary target this summer as they look to increase their homegrown quota . And the club plan to make a major statement by making a formal offer for the forward at the earliest possible opportunity this summer . Man City are planning a mega-bid to sign Liverpool star Raheem Sterling when the transfer window reopens . Sterling , pictured against Newcastle on Monday night , is a primary target for Manchester City this summer . The transfer window officially opens on July 1 , but deals can be discussed between clubs prior to that date . City believe they are leading the race to land Sterling this summer and are confident they can complete what would be one of the biggest transfers this summer . Liverpool value Sterling at around Â£ 50million , a fee that City can certain afford . But City will have to be cute in their attempts to land Sterling given the threat of Financial Fair Play sanctions . They may look to use other players as bait , but Liverpool are likely to demand a straight cash fee . The Liverpool forward has been pictured smoking a shisha pipe with team-mate Jordon Ibe earlier this season .
