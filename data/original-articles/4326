Manchester United are to hand trials to MK Dons teenagers Luke Tingey and Kyran Wiltshire . Central defender Tingey , 18 , became a hit on YouTube last month when he scored a sensational 40 yard free-kick against Swindon in a 5-3 win for MK Dons Under-18s . Wiltshire , also 18 , is a lively centre midfielder who was included in Karl Robinson 's first-team squad for friendlies last pre-season . Kyran Wiltshire is pictured in action for MK Dons in their pre-season friendly against a Tottenham XI in 2013 . Their U18 side have been crowned Youth Alliance South Cup champions for this season and face Oldham in the national final on Monday , April 27 . United are looking to bring in some talented younger players to boost squad numbers ahead of next season 's UEFA U19 Youth League competition . Tingey and Wiltshire are expected to spend a few days at Carrington as coaches assess whether they can prove useful additions to United 's squad .
