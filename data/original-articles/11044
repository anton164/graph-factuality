' A picture of the legend of St George and the Dragon . The medieval legend of St George and the dragon is over a thousand years old . St George travelled to Libya , where he met an old hermit who told him a dragon had long ravaged the country , demanding the sacrifice of a beautiful maiden every day . With the population of young girls decimated , the king 's daughter alone remained to be sacrificed , unless a knight could slay the dragon . Determined to save the princess , he set out to slay the dragon , luring it from its cave upon his arrival . But after falling from his horse , St George evaded the dragon 's attack by hiding under an enchanted orange tree before recovering his strength and killing the beast with his sword . The slaying of the dragon by St George , a brave Roman soldier who protested against the Romans ' torture of Christians , was first credited to him in the twelfth century , long after his death . The real St George was thought to be a Roman soldier , born to Christian parents in A.D. 270 in what is now Eastern Turkey . Adomn√°n , the Abbot of Iona in Scotland , provides Britain 's earliest recorded reference to Saint George in the 7th Century . He details the story of the Saint 's exploits , which had been told to him by a French bishop named Arcuif who had travelled to Jerusalem with the crusaders . As the Crusaders returned to England from foreign shores , they brought with them tales of St George , and his reputation grew . A church in Fordington , Dorset , still records St George leading the Crusaders into battle . St George later resigned his military post and protested against Emperor Diocletian against his persecution of Christians . He was dragged through the streets and executed on April 23 , 303 AD . Almost a millenia later in 1222 the Council of Oxford declared April 23rd to be St George 's Day . It was not until 1348 that St George became the Patron Saint of England . Today April 23 is celebrated as a day of patriotism for England .
