Mark Johnson , a presenter on Share Radio 's breakfast show , told MailOnline : ` I live in Kennington and cycle across Lambeth Bridge every day to our studios near Millbank , so I know how dangerous the roundabout is at the north end of the bridge . ` I 'm also very concerned at the speed that construction lorries travel at in the built up urban areas of Central London . ' He added : ` I spoke to police officers at the scene who said they are also very concerned about the issue , but that unfortunately they do n't have any authority to make safety changes . ` They said it 's the borough councils that need to redesign the road layouts to ensure cycle safety .
