Carefree : Linda MacDonald , 55 , was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol Monday night in Dummerston , Vermont . This mugshot certainly wo n't be winning any points with the judge . Linda MacDonald , 55 , was arrested on Monday for drunk driving and decided to stick out her tongue when she was brought to Vermont State Police barracks for booking . Police say the woman from Shelburne , Massachusetts was driving drunk around 10:30 pm when she ran off Route 5 in Dummerston , Vermont and crashed her 2011 Toyota Camry into a wooden fence . At the scene , MacDonald told responding officers that she crashed while talking on the phone and trying to take directions down on a legal note pad in her car . But when officers smelled alcohol on MacDonald , they administered a breathalyzer test and she posted a .10 blood-alcohol content - above the state 's legal threshold of .08 . MacDonald stuck out her tongue for the cheeky picture after she was arrested and brought back to police headquarters on charges of driving while intoxicated . Police say that though MacDonald 's car was heavily damaged , neither she or anyone else was injured in the one-vehicle crash . MacDonald was released on a citation and is scheduled back in court on April 28 for an arraignment . Public records do not indicate MacDonald has been arrested for DWI in the past . Sentencing for a first offense in Vermont range from a license suspension of 90 days to up to two years in prison and a maximum fine of $ 750 .
