A dramatic confrontation between an alleged Army impostor and a bystander in Florida has been caught on video . Eric Coins , who was drinking in the city of Sunrise posted the video to YouTube accusing the man of wearing the uniform to get free drinks and meet women . The stand-off between the two men almost comes to blows as Coins tells the man : ` There are people who f ****** die in that uniform . ' In the footage , a young man is seen on camera asking the alleged fake service member , a series of questions including where he did his basic and boot camp training . The man apparently says he did his basic training in North Carolina . The young man is then heard saying basic training is conducted in Fort Benning , Georgia and not Miami . Scroll down for video . A man -LRB- above -RRB- believed to be impersonating as an Army Infantry is captured in an emotionally-charged video with two men angry that he appears to be a phony in uniform without a name tape . The man wearing the uniform makes a comment that the guy confronting him is asking a lot of questions and then asks if he is in the army - to which the young man responds ` no . ' As the confrontation continues , the young man asks the ` fake army infantryman ' where his name badge is as he replies he ` took it out ' because he ` does not want nobody knowing his name ' , before asking the young man if he is a cop . The young man is then seen on camera saying , ` you know it 's a federal offense what you 're doing right now . Do you know where infantry camp is ? It 's in Fort Benning , Georgia . ' Following a commotion , the encounter gets increasingly tense as they begin raising their voices and shouting expletives at each other . The encounter begins with the young man approaches the ` fake service member ' asking him a series of questions including where he did his basic and boot camp training . As the confrontation became tense , bar staff came over to tend to the shouting men -LRB- above one member of staff tries to stop the ` fake service member ' -RRB- after the young man asked for his Geneva Conventions Identification Card . The young man says : ` Do you realize what you are doing is a federal offense ... where is your Geneva Conventions Identification Card ? ' The man responds ` Do n't f ****** try me n ***** . What 's wrong with this mother f ***** ? as he starts to instigate a fight . The young man then says angrily ` do you realize what you 're doing is a federal offense ' as the man walks over to him unbuttoning his shirt . The young man adds : ` There are people who f ****** die in that uniform . ' The man shouts back ` I 'm in the f ***** army mother f ****** . ' In a second video posted by Coins , the bar 's staff is seen holding back the man claiming to be an infantryman as his shirt is open . The young man is then heard shouting : ` Infantry boot camp is in f ****** Fort Benning not Miami dumb a ** . ' The man shouts back ` f *** you mother f ****** ' as staff try to stop a physical confrontation from occurring between the pair . The young man -LRB- pictured far right -RRB- shouted at the man : ` There are people who f ****** die in that uniform ' The incident captured in Sunrise , Florida comes after a panhandler in Tampa was called out for faking military connection by wearing a camouflage uniform . On YouTube Coins describes the incident writing : ` This guy was trying to pick up girls and get sympathy drinks in a battle ready uniform which was n't even on properly let alone , wearing it at a bar . ` So we asked a few basic questions which threw him off and could n't answer even where he got his infantry training or even boot camp for that matter ... he 's a scum to America and we could n't let that fly . ' The incident comes after an angry Army veteran called out a panhandler in Tampa , Florida last month for faking a military connection by wearing a camouflage uniform . Garrett Goodwin , who spent nearly 10 years in the Army as a combat medic , spotted the allegedly phony veteran while driving down the main road to MacDill Air Force Base on Sunday . When he first spoke with the beggar , Goodwin started to get suspicious since he claimed to be special forces but was wearing a Junior ROTC patch on his uniform . He then had a friend record him as he went back up to the panhandler and demanded to see his veterans ID card , which the unidentified panhandler said he did n't have . The clip then shows Goodwin pursuing the beggar across a busy intersection as he berates the man for wearing a uniform that ` my brothers died in ' . The panhandler eventually discards of the uniform and Goodwin tells him to not put it back on . While he ca n't be 100 per cent certain that the man he confronted is n't a veteran , he says he 's positive based on the panhandler 's shamed reaction , riding off on his bike after the incident .
