Three men have today been arrested on suspicion of murdering missing chef Claudia Lawrence . Three men arrested on suspicion of the murder of missing chef Claudia Lawrence have been released on bail . The three men , who are in their 50s are all from the York area . The trio were questioned over night by police investigating the chef 's disappearance . Ms Lawrence was 35 when she vanished on March 18 , 2009 . Her father , Peter , reported her missing after she failed to turn up to work in the canteen of the University of York for her 6 am shift . Detectives previously questioned a man in his 50s from York in March in connection with Ms Lawrence 's murder . He remains on police bail . A North Yorkshire Police spokesman said : ` Although they have been released from custody , proceedings in this case - as they relate to them - remain active . ' Officers confirmed that Ms Lawrence 's parents have been kept informed of current developments . Detectives are currently looking for evidence which could lead to the discovery of Ms Lawrence 's body . Specialist teams of forensic officers have searched three locations in the York area looking for evidence . Detectives began reviewing the case in 2013 and have since carried out a number of searches , including a detailed re-examination of Miss Lawrence 's home , in the Heworth area of York , and a fingertip search of an alleyway that leads to the rear of the house . They have also issued previously unseen CCTV footage of two people walking near the house . The new arrests , and the arrest in March , are understood to be linked to these lines of inquiry . Detective Superintendent Dai Malyn , head of North Yorkshire Police 's Major Crime Unit and the senior investigating officer in the Claudia Lawrence inquiry , said : ` I urge everyone to again show restraint and patience while we carry out these very important enquiries . Your co-operation and support is greatly appreciated by the investigation team . ' Miss Lawrence -LRB- right -RRB- was reported missing by her father Peter -LRB- left -RRB- on March 18 , 2009 . Specialist forensic officers searched the houses of the three suspects and their gardens . Officers completed their searches earlier this afternoon before the three men were released on police bail . There has been a Â£ 10,000 reward for information which will lead to the whereabouts of Miss Lawrence . Neighbours said the police arrived at 7 am on Wednesday before cordoning off each of the houses . People living around the homes that are being searched said officers arrived just before 7 am yesterday . At the address nearest to Miss Lawrence home , uniformed police wearing face masks could be seen carrying out brown evidence bags . Martin Dales , friend of Claudia 's father , said the new arrests were a positive movement in the investigation but that progress was a series of ups and downs for the family . Speaking outside the chef 's house , he said : ` Peter finds it very hard , going up and down . ` You feel like you might be getting somewhere and then you get let down . ` Three arrests is certainly a big movement for the police though . ` That 's four people in the space of one month .

Officers stood guard while the searches continued and potential evidence was recovered from the houses . ` The public has been tremendous in keeping information coming which has helped the police . ' Mr Dales added : ` Someone is withholding the truth and that is despicable . ` Imagine if it was your daughter and you were sitting around waiting for answers and somebody , for their own skin , was trying to be obstructive . ` I hope the full force of the law comes down on them . ' A resident living near one of the houses said police arrived at around 7 am yesterday . Tommy Ward , 81 , said : ` It started off with one police car then a few more came . ` It was just around about 7 am when everything started up . ` I was outside my house watching the world go by at the time . ` I have n't seen anyone arrested but a few weeks ago some sniffer dogs were there in the same house . We 've had dogs a few times now . I do n't know the person who lives there . ' Peter Lawrence with a photograph of his daughter in the chapel at Bishopthorpe Palace , York .
