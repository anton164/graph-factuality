It has been nicknamed ` the Da Pinchi Code ' . The seemingly meaningless symbols have been daubed on walls or pavements . But the squiggles are actually thought to be a ` code ' for crooks , giving potential housebreakers details about the building , such as whether it is a good target or has an alarm , or been targeted before successfully .

These signs have been seen in East Kilbride , please retweet & report all sightings . ' The officers ' post features a graphic with eight different codes and what they might mean .

They also said there was nothing to suggest the markings in the area correlate to a particular meaning .

In January , an elderly couple in Devon were mystified when a series of dodgy tradesmen kept calling at their home . The visits took place over five years , but the homeowners could not work out why they were being singled out . Following an investigation it emerged that a rogue builder who paved their drive had left a code in a pattern of blocks to tip off other cowboy traders that the owners were a vulnerable target . The builder , who overcharged the couple by Â£ 4,000 , left the job unfinished in August 2009 but he created a squared pattern of different coloured blocks at the centre of the driveway . The residents had not asked for the pattern but thought nothing of it until other tradesman began calling at their home in Plymstock offering to carry out work that was not required .
