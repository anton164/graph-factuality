Negotiations to make a fight between Paul Smith and Andre Ward are set to be concluded this week , with the Liverpool super-middleweight set to meet one of boxing 's biggest talents on June 20 . Sportsmail understands discussions are virtually finalised for the summer showdown , with a formal announcement of the fight expected imminently . Elements of the deal are still being rubber-stamped and Ward 's WBA world title is unlikely to be on the line . However , the fight , which will be staged in Oakland , California , will run over the 12-round distance . Liverpool boxer Paul Smith -LRB- left -RRB- is in line to take on Andre Ward on June 20 . Ward -LRB- right -RRB- has won all of his 24 bouts but has not fought since defeating Edwin Rodriguez in November . It is a huge opportunity for Smith but an even bigger task against a fighter who outclassed Carl Froch in 2011 . Smith , 32 , has lost back-to-back world title challenges in Germany against Arthur Abraham , albeit in controversial circumstances in the first of those fights when a wide decision was handed to Abraham from a close bout . Smith has lost his last two world title challenges to Arthur Abraham -LRB- left -RRB- of Germany . Ward defeated Carl Froch in 2011 and could be set for a rematch if he beats Smith . Smith 's hope this time round will be that Ward , usually so slick and brilliantly accurate , has diminished through inactivity . The 31-year-old , an Olympic champion and winner of all 27 of his professional fights , has not fought since November 2013 . That period of absence will add a fascinating dimension to a fight that will catch the attention of Froch , who would postpone retirement for a home rematch against Ward .
