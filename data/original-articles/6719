The Queen had her fingers firmly crossed but luck was not on her side as he annual visit to Newbury 's opening ended with two near-misses . Capel Path , ridden by Ryan Moore and trained by Sir Michael Stoute , finished third to Richard Hannon 's Desert Force in the Dubai Duty Free Full of Surprises Handicap but it was the Queen 's Hannon-trained two-year-old Ring of Truth who looked the one who got away . The 7-1 shot , making her debut in the five furlong Al Basti Equiworld Maiden Stakes , took time to understand what was required of her as she showed understandable signs of inexperience but the Richard Hughes-ridden daughter of Royal Applause was closing hard on winner Harvard Man at the line and was only touched off by short head . The Queen crossed her fingers for the race but only managed to come close with two near-misses at Newbury . The Queen looked like she was enjoying her day out at Newbury despite not backing a winner at the races .

It was a performance , which if built upon , could make Ring Of Truth worthy of a potential tilt at a race at Royal Ascot . Hannon said : ' It was a nice run and she will be better at six furlongs . ' The royal meeting is the likely destination of Brian Meehan-trained Harvard Man , a fourth winner from seven rides in Britain this season for Italian jockey Antonio Fresu . Meehan said : ` I think this fellow will go places . All spring he has shown to be a really nice colt . I took him to Kempton for a day out three or four weeks ago for a little school and he was very impressive .
