A Labour politician who stood against Britain 's first elected Muslim mayor has won a High Court battle over claims that he was a ` wife beater ' . Helal Abbas , 55 , lost his bid to become the mayor of Tower Hamlets in East London days after the claim appeared in an ethnic freesheet . The race was won by Lutfur Rahman , 50 , a controversial figure who has been accused in a separate High Court case of rigging his re-election victory last year . Mr Rahman denies those charges . Helal Abbas , 55 , lost his bid to become the mayor of Tower Hamlets in East London days after the claim appeared in an ethnic freesheet . During the 2010 campaign , the London Bangla ran an advert accusing Mr Abbas of assaulting his ex-wife . An article accompanying the advert was headlined A Right Mayoral Punch-Up . The weekly freesheet -- written in Bengali and English -- was a fierce supporter of Mr Rahman and was distributed outside mosques in the area . Mr Abbas lost the election by 12,000 votes . The victory by Mr Rahman -- a former Labour councillor who stood as an independent after he was thrown out of the party over alleged links to Islamists -- was seen as an embarrassment for Ed Miliband . The race was won by Lutfur Rahman , 50 , a controversial figure who has been accused in a separate High Court case of rigging his re-election victory last year . Mr Abbas started court proceedings against London Bangla 's editor , Shah Yousuf , 35 , soon after the election . After a four-year legal battle , Mr Yousuf has admitted there was ` no truth to the allegation ' and has agreed to pay damages and legal costs . When The Mail on Sunday contacted Mr Yousuf , he asked for all questions to be emailed to him , which we did . However , he then refused to answer them .
