UEFA has published Champions League regulations for next season confirming a seeding change to reward national league winners . Top-seeded teams in eight groups will be the defending Champions League winner plus title holders in the seven highest-ranked countries . On current standings , Arsenal , Atletico Madrid and Porto will drop in status in the August 27 draw . Arsenal , who were knocked out by Monaco this season , could drop down in the pots for the group stages . Chelsea look to be marching towards the Premier League title so would stay in pot 1 . If Real Madrid do n't win La Liga or the Champions League they will be in pot 2 next season . If things stay as they are in Europe ... Champions League winner . Barcelona . Bayern Munich . Chelsea . Juventus . PSG . Zenit . Benfica . Real Madrid would also drop down if Barcelona wins the Champions League and Spanish league . If the Champions League winner also wins its national title , then the eighth top-seeded team is the Dutch champions . That is PSV Eindhoven , which is only 30th in UEFA 's club standings . Currently , top-seeded teams are the eight highest-ranked in a five-year results cycle in UEFA competitions . The new system should elevate league-leading Juventus and Zenit St Petersburg , plus France 's champions . Porto are trailing Benfica in Primeira Liga so would also miss out on pot 1 in the Champions League . PSV would benefit if the winners of the Champions League also won their domestic title .
