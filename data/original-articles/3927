Aston Villa take on Liverpool in their FA Cup semi-final encounter on Sunday with the competition both sides ' last chance to win any silverware this season . Sportsmail columnist Jamie Redknapp looks ahead to the Wembley showdown and where the match could be won and lost with individual player duels . CHRISTIAN BENTEKE v MARTIN SKRTEL . This will be a heavyweight contest that could decide the game . Christian Benteke is superb in the air and Martin Skrtel will have his hands full . Liverpool have to stop the supply line because defending crosses has been their Achilles heel this season . Christian Benteke -LRB- centre -RRB- scored the only goal of the game as Villa won 1-0 at Tottenham on April 11 . Liverpool defender Martin Skrtel -LRB- right -RRB- will have his hands full trying to stop Benteke on Sunday afternoon . FABIAN DELPH v JORDAN HENDERSON . This should be a good contest between two England team-mates . Fabian Delph 's new deal was a real boost for Villa - he drives that midfield , though he does n't get enough goals . You used to say the same about Jordan Henderson but he has improved so much . England international Fabian Delph -LRB- left -RRB- and Jordan Henderson are set for a midfield battle at Wembley . RAHEEM STERLING v RON VLAAR and NATHAN BAKER . Ron Vlaar and Nathan Baker make an imposing back line but they would rather be up against a Benteke than a Raheem Sterling , who will float around and make himself difficult to mark so he can use his lightning pace to get in behind them . Raheem Sterling 's -LRB- left -RRB- pace and trickery is bound to cause the Villa defence a lot of problems . Ron Vlaar -LRB- left -RRB- was part of the Villa defence that kept a clean sheet at Spurs in the Premier League . The Holland international and Nathan Baker -LRB- right -RRB- will be hoping to do likewise against the Reds at Wembley .
