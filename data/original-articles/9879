Chelsea are looking to beat Manchester City to sign Brazilian prospect Nathan . The attacking midfielder turned 19 last month but has been in contract dispute with his club Atletico Paranaense . He is due to speak to Chelsea next week ahead of a proposed move to Stamford Bridge which would likely see him loaned out . Atletico Paranaense attacking midfielder Nathan is attracting interest from Chelsea and Manchester City . Jose Mourinho and Manuel Pellegrini will go head-to-head to sign Brazilian starlet Nathan . Manchester City have been keen on Nathan following his performances in the World U17 Championships two years ago and he has since broken into Paranaense 's first team . Chelsea have a strong Brazilian contingency with the likes of Willian , Ramires , Filipe Luis and Oscar while 21-year-old Lucas Piazon is on loan at Eintracht Frankfurt . Nathan would join fellow Brazilians Willian , Ramires , Filipe Luis and Oscar -LRB- pictured -RRB- at Stamford Bridge .
