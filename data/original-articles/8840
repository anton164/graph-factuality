Tony Pulis believes Joey Barton ` probably had a point ' when claiming West Bromwich Albion 's players 's *** themselves ' during defeat to Queens Park Rangers earlier this season . In December West Brom were two goals up but lost to a Charlie Austin hat-trick , leading to Barton 's scathing judgement and plunging Alan Irvine to the brink of the sack . Barton said then : ` West Brom went 2-0 up and I turned to Dunney -LRB- Richard Dunne -RRB- and said , ` they 've scored too early . ' They do n't know how to get over the finishing line . ' Tony Pulis has admitted that Joey Barton ` probably had a point ' about West Brom losing their cool . The outspoken midfielder -LRB- right -RRB- was commenting after West Brom surrendered a two-goal lead . The teams meet again at the Hawthorns on Saturday with Pulis having instilled a solid core to the point Albion have not conceded after scoring first in a game . ` Whatever Joey says or whatever he does he 's entitled to hid views and his opinions , ' Pulis said . ` The club were 2-0 up and lost 3-2 so he most probably had a point , or he felt he had a point to say something on that subject . ' Pulis recalled his own misfortune from leading 2-0 and losing as Gillingham manager in the Second Division play-off final of 1999 . ` I 've managed teams that have been 2-0 up with only for or five minutes to go and ended up drawing then losing on penalties . 1999 Man City Wembley , ' he added . ` So I ca n't talk about being indestructible in respect to leads . ` We 've played really well I do n't think they 've just been good results . The performances have been really , really good . We 're hoping we 'll continue that now . ' QPR striker Charlie Austin scores a header to seal a hat-trick and a comeback win against West Brom . Austin claims the match ball after helping QPR to comeback from two goals down to win 3-2 in December .
