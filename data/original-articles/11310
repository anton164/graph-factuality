Sampdoria have revived their interest in Mario Balotelli should he choose to take a pay cut . Eccentric club president Massimo Ferrero says the talented but frustrating 24-year-old has lost his desire for football and needs to go to Stadio Luigi Ferraris to re-discover himself . Liverpool have been willing to sell Balotelli since January but could find no takers after signing him for £ 16m . Mario Balotelli has only scored once in the Premier League since his switch to Liverpool last summer . The Italian striker is set to leave the club at the end of the season and Sampdoria want to sign him . The Sampdoria president Massimo Ferrero says that Balotelli has lost his hunger . Ferrero said Balotelli should be put on a diet of bread and water and given a Bianchina -LRB- a small car from the 1960s -RRB- instead of a Ferrari . His agent Mino Raiola has also hinted Liverpool would have to pay him off first after saying he wanted to finish his contract and prove to the Anfield crowd he was good enough . Tentative loan offers have been proposed and Sampdoria would likely offer a cut price permanent move . Ferrero said : ` I 'd sign him . If he came to Sampdoria , he would come back to his usual standards . Here nobody would bother him if he missed a goal , he would be quiet and happy . ' Talking to Gazzetta TV , Ferrero added : ` In my opinion he 's not hungry anymore , he earns 4 million euros -LRB- £ 2.9 m -RRB- a year . We should put him on bread and water , give him a Bianchina -LSB- a small car from the 1960s -RSB- rather than a Ferrari ... then I 'm sure he would score again . '
