This guy had a gun ... Why did n't you stop this guy before he shot my wife , before he shot my husband , before he shot my child ? ' ' In February , Sergeant Chris Warren also appeared to support the deliberate crash , telling KOLD that Valencia ` was a dangerous felon who 'd been on a crime spree throughout the morning ' . This crime spree allegedly involved theft at a convenience store at Columbus Avenue and 29th Street , vandalism and burglary at the Tucson Baptist Temple , a home invasion and theft of a car .

It 's a busy time of morning , a lot of employees at work , ' said Sgt Warren . ` We had to take immediate action and make sure he did n't get inside those businesses . ' Rapiejko was put on standard administrative leave after the crash , because it was considered use of force . However , the Pima County Attorney 's Office cleared the officer of any wrongdoing and he is back on the force , Sgt Warren said .
