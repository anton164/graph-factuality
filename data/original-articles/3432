Jack Wilshere is reportedly on the shopping list of Manchester City this summer , but the Arsenal midfielder showed off his own trolley dash during his day off on Monday . Wilshere has been forced to miss five months of this season following ankle surgery in November , but the England midfielder is closing in on a return to full fitness . Before that long-awaited return to first-team duty , and before loading the boot of his car , the 23-year-old was keen to share his staple food requirements with his 891,000 instagram followers . Jack Wilshere in action for Arsenal U21s recently and his overflowing Waitrose shopping trolley . And Wilshere clearly loves a bowl of cereal . A Â£ 2.15 box of Seriously Fruity Mixed Berry Crisp can be seen spilling out of one bag close to his trolley handlebar next to what appears to be an Oats and Honey 500g version of Special K . The standard refuel of a dozen eggs and a four-pack of baked beans provide crucial protein to strengthen the Arsenal star 's muscles , while a smartly packed corn in the cob also seems to have been ticked off at the top of the trolley . Football managers across the country breathe a huge sigh of relief after each transfer deadline day following a frantic last-minute dash to the shops before the window slams shut . And Wilshere was clearly left panting after his mad Monday aisle sweep , as he posted a photo onto his Instagram account with the caption , ` This is how my day off was spent ... now the worst part , Putting it all away !!! #HelpMe ' . Wilshere called on his social media followers to help him lift out the contents of his shopping trolley on Monday .
