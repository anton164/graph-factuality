Arsenal should target Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech if he leaves Stamford Bridge at the end of the season , insists Carlo Cudicini . Cech has made just five Barclays Premier League appearances this season as Thibaut Courtois remains manager Jose Mourinho 's first-choice goalkeeper . But Cudicini feels the 32-year-old Czech Republic international would be a good fit under Arsene Wenger instead of Wojciech Szczesny at Arsenal . Petr Cech , in action for Czech Republic against Latvia last week , is poised to leave Chelsea in the summer . Cech , who joined Chelsea in 2004 , has made just five Premier League appearances this season . Chelsea want at least Â£ 10million for Cech , and they would have to sell to a direct rival for the goalkeeper to end up at the Emirates . Prompted on TalkSport by Ray Parlour who said Arsenal ` have to get ' Cech , Cudicini added : ` I agree . ` Arsenal have had a few problems with goalkeepers after -LSB- David -RSB- Seaman and -LSB- Jens -RSB- Lehmann . ` Szczesny is still struggling to impose himself as number one , so if a goalkeeper like Petr Cech is available in the summer , obviously he should be a big target for Arsenal . ' Cech revealed last week he does not want to spend another season as understudy to Courtois .
