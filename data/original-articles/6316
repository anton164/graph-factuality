Who does n't love a hot cross bun at Easter ? In Britain we so enjoy the spiced , sweet rolls with a cross on top , that they used to be eaten all year round . That was until Queen Elizabeth I tried to ban them , possibly finding the cross a little too Catholic . The move was greeted with uproar , so she compromised , saying they could only be sold on Good Friday , at Christmas and for burials -- and they have been prime Easter fare ever since . Nowadays supermarkets bring out ever more permutations to tempt customers , from miniature sizes to new flavours like toffee fudge chunk and apple and cinnamon . Here is best of the batch this Easter . Harriet Arkell -LRB- pictured -RRB- has tested out the best hot cross buns on offer this Easter . ELEVENSES TREAT .
