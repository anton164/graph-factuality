Residents on the east coast of Japan 's Hokkaido Island had an unexpected change of scenery this morning after 1,000 ft of seabed was forced to the surface overnight . The extra stretch of coastline on Shiretoko Peninsula near the town of Rausu has risen as high as 50ft from the sea surface in some places , exposing what used to be the ocean floor . Geologists believe the emergence is a result of a landslide nearby , when melting ice and snow caused a section of land to drop , pivoting the underwater area into the air . Scroll down for video .
