Kris Jenner looked downcast and emotional as she drove herself to a Beverly Hills gym on Monday as she continues to deal with the fall-out from ex-husband Bruce Jenner 's TV tell-all . The Olympic gold medalist confirmed to the world on Friday that ` to all intents and purposes I am a woman ' and said his third wife Kris , like his previous two wives , knew about his desire to be female . Diane Sawyer said during the ABC 20/20 special that Kris had declined to comment on her husband 's gender transition even though previous two wives issued messages of support that were read out on the program . On Monday , close family friend Kathie Lee Gifford said on NBC 's Today that Kris did n't know Bruce 's secret and she 's still ` trying to get her act together ' when it comes to dealing with the news .

Shocked : Kathie Lee Gifford said on Today on Monday that she had n't seen Bruce 's bombshell news coming and neither had her close friend Kris , saying that the momager was struggling to cope with the revelations . ` The other ladies , both fine women , had a long time to get used to this . This was new to Kris , ' Kathie Lee told Today co-host Hoda Kotb . She said Kris , who was married to Bruce for 22 years , is ` trying to be a good friend to him - or her - now . ' ` Trying to still be a great parent , and it 's complicated in ways that we can not even comprehend . ' The TV personality is a godmother to Bruce and Kris ' daughters Kendall , 19 , and Kylie , 17 , and has known the ex couple for years . But her version of events is clearly at odds with what Bruce himself had to say to Diane Sawyer , including the claim that had Kris been accepting of his situation , they would ` probably still be together . ' He told Sawyer that Kris had seen him cross-dressing and knew that he had developed 36B breasts because he could no longer hide them from her .

Kathie Lee , who 's been married to sports commentator Frank Gifford since 1986 , said on Today she was shocked by the news that Bruce identifies as female . ` I never saw this coming , I 've got to tell you , ' she said . ` It would have shocked me as much if Frank had told me -LSB- the same thing . -RSB- ' But she insists that she is supportive of the former star athlete and reality TV star . ` How do you deal with that -LSB- the news -RSB- ? The way you do , ultimately , is when you put love first , and try to put yourself in someone else 's high heels I suppose , ' she said . She also revealed that she had a long frank conversation with Bruce before his TV interview aired so she was prepared for what he said and also how to deal with the situation moving forward . ` We all want to love him through this and we all know there are children who are going to have to learn to deal with this , ' she said . ` The story is n't over obviously .
