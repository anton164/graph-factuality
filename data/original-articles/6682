In her recording of the incident , Ms Eden is heard fuming : ` She wears it -LRB- her hijab -RRB- for herself , OK ! ' ` She wears it because she wants to be modest with her body , not because of people like you who are going to sit there and disrespect her .

Ms Eden was not having a bar of it . ` That is not her doing it . That is a minority of people . Not a majority of people OK ? ` It does n't matter what they 're doing ...
