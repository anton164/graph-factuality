The BBC has been slammed for making a computer game simulating the terrifying ordeal Syrian refugees face as they try to flee their war-torn country .

Grim outcomes include being separated from your family by human traffickers , women being sold between militia groups , and refugees being beaten over the head and hurled into the Mediterranean from packed migrant ships . Middle East expert Chris Walker told The Sun : ` In the midst of probably the bloodiest Syrian crisis this century , the decision of the BBC to transform the human suffering of literally millions into a children 's game beggars belief . ' Twitter users reacted furiously to the game , which appeared on the BBC site last Wednesday . One wrote : ` The BBC news page has an interactive journey on the decisions you make as a Syrian migrant trying to flee the country ... sickening .
