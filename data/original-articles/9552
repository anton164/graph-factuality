Born in 1994 , Depay started out at hometown club VV Moordrecht - a Dutch amateur side in south Holland - at the age of six before joining Sparta Rotterdam three years later . The son of a Ghanaian father and Dutch mother , Depay moved to PSV at the age of 12 before making his first-team debut in September 2011 having impressed during a trial . Depay signed his first professional contract in June 2012 and has already made over 100 appearances for the Dutch giants . Playing style . Pacy , with neat close control , Depay loves to run at defenders and completed the most dribbles in the entire Eredivisie during the 2013/14 campaign . Adding more goals to his game this season , the youngster is more than capable at shooting from distance and boasts an explosive right-foot . Often playing on the left-wing and cutting inside , Depay is strong on the ball and has more than a few tricks up his sleeve to bamboozle opponents . However , still at a young age and learning the game , the 21-year-old can sometimes be guilty of making the wrong pass or keeping hold of the ball for too long .

I like him better . ` Ronaldo did the same things wrong at Manchester United as he did when he was 17 . ' Meanwhile , former Holland midfielder Cocu said of Depay : ` Whether he can be as good as Arjen Robben ? I think so . ` They are different players , but they are both fast and have a good shot . And both always have the urge to learn . ` But Memphis is only 21-years-old and only in a few years can real conclusions be drawn . ' Depay 's PSV team-mate Stijn Schaars is also a fan and told Helden Online : ` He 's doing everything to reach the top . ` He has a body of a true athlete , power and flair . I 'm not afraid of him losing his head . His drive is huge . I like him a lot . ' International star and World Cup goalscorer . Depay was handed his first Oranje call-up by Louis van Gaal in 2013 and was selected for Holland 's World Cup squad a year later . The energetic frontman scored the winning goal in Holland 's 3-2 victory over Australia , before coming off the bench to net against Chile and help Van Gaal 's men seal top spot in Group B. Having impressed in Brazil , Depay was nominated for the tournament 's ` Best Young Player ' award but lost out to France midfielder Paul Pogba .
