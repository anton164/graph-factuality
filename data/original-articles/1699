There were many moving parts . ' Earlier today , the interior ministry revealed the identity of one of the four gunmen responsible for the massacre on Thursday . Abdirahim Mohammed Abdullahi was the son of a government chief in Mandera County , Interior Ministry spokesman Mwenda Njoka said .

Kenyan troops searching the building were alarmed when they heard sounds coming from inside a wardrobe .

A photograph from inside one of the classrooms at the university has emerged , showing at least 12 bodies strewn across the floor , which is covered in blood . At least three people appear to have been huddled in fear in the corner of the room when they were murdered by the militant Islamists .

' In a chilling warning today , the terrorist group said more attacks like the university massacre were planned . ` Kenyan cities will run red with blood , ' al-Shabab said in a statement , according to the SITE intelligence monitoring group . The militants said the barbaric attack was in retaliation for killings carried out by Kenyan troops fighting the rebels in Somalia . ` This will be a long , gruesome war of which you , the Kenyan public , are its first casualties . ` No amount of precaution or safety measures will be able to guarantee your safety , thwart another attack or prevent another bloodbath . ' Kenya 's President Uhuru Kenyatta said today that those behind the attack were ` deeply embedded ' in Kenya , and called on Kenyan Muslims to help prevent radicalisation . ` Our task of countering terrorism has been made all the more difficult by the fact that the planners and financiers of this brutality are deeply embedded in our communities , ' he said in a televised speech . ` Radicalisation that breeds terrorism is not conducted in the bush at night . It occurs in the full glare of day , in madrasas , in homes , and in mosques with rogue imams . '
