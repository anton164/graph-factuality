Tragedy : Dr. Frederic Brandt was battling with extreme depression before his suicide on Sunday a police report revealed on Tuesday . A friend insists Fredric Brandt was offended by a character on Tina Fey 's new TV show that bore uncanny similarities to him - despite initial claims he ` laughed it off ' . The cosmetologist killed himself on Easter Sunday , weeks after the March 6 launch of The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt on Netflix . In it , Martin Short plays a caricatured white-haired cosmetologist called Dr Franff with an inordinate amount of fillers in his face . Friends admit Brandt identified the resemblance - but most claim he jovially pointed it out and laughed . However , another friend , hair colorist Kyle White , told the New York Times his reaction was a front . ` He never thought it was fun , ' White told the paper . ` He was about putting on a happy face in public . ' The character has been targeted as a ` breaking point ' for Brandt , who had allegedly started spending his Saturday nights at home injecting himself with fillers . One of his clients and friends Rosemary Hayt told the paper she spotted syringes for fillers in his bathroom at home in Chelsea , New York . She said : ` I thought , `` Oh , Fred , this is n't a good thing to be doing alone on a Saturday night . '' ` It was disturbing thing , and I did n't want to think about it . ' According to a growing body of voices , this worrying behavior was exacerbated by The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt . Sources close to Brandt said the doctor , who suffered from depression , told People magazine he was ` definitely hurt ' by an apparent portrayal of himself on the Netflix show . The friend called the Kimmy Schmidt send up ` bullying , ' but added that it did not cause his suicide . Sources were today opening up about how Brandt was wounded by the characterization - though they said that this suicide could not be pinned on one insulting TV show . A friend speaking to People said : ` It was making fun of him for the way he looked and it was mean and it was bullying . ' ... It was n't the only thing troubling him , it was just one factor . It definitely hurt him . He was absolutely upset , who would want that ? But that was not why he committed suicide . But it did n't help . ' Another source , speaking to the New York Daily News , said that Brandt had become fixated on his appearance and cried in front of patients . The source said : ` He worked 15-hour days , his office was jam-packed , and I paid him a compliment . He was so sensitive he started to cry . He said how awful the public was , and how mean people are . He was really affected by negative feedback . ' Scroll down for videos .

Abravanel said that sources told her Dr Brandt was ` devastated ' over comparisons to the enthusiastic doctor on Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt . The plastic surgeon , Dr Franff , in the Netflix comedy , is played by comedy veteran Martin Short and had drawn unflattering comparisons to real-life Dr Brandt . In one scene , where the lead character Kimmy almost gets plastic surgery , the doctor is seen drinking from a hamster feeder . Martin Short had a small role as Dr Franff in one episode of the TV show 's first season . When he is punched by the main character , Kimmy , as she struggles to escape the plastic surgeon 's chair , his face dents like putty - which he then inflates with an air tube .

In the episode , he cheerily suggests several barbaric-sounding surgeries for Jacqueline , as well as on Kimmy . Franff 's platinum blond hair and tight skin have a stark resemblance to that of cosmetic dermatologist Fredric Brandt . Dr Brandt was famed for his appearance , which displayed many of his dermatology techniques . In a 2014 profile in The New York Times , he said that his goal was to ` restore the face to harmony ' . ` I approach each face with a visual perception , an artistic perception and a medical perception , ' he said .

It was also widely known that Dr Brandt injected products including Botox , Restylane , Perlane , Juv√©derm , Voluma , The Times reported , into his own face , erasing his wrinkles , leaving him with full lips and an ageless quality . The doctor told The Times that people often asked him if he was from Sweden . Brandt grew up in Weequahic neighborhood of Newark , New Jersey where his parents ran a candy store . His father died when he was a teenager and he lost his mother before he graduated from Rutgers University in 1971 . He went on to attend Hahnemann Medical College in Philadelphia . He completed residencies at NYU 's Department of Internal Medicine and then in Dermatology at the University of Miami .
