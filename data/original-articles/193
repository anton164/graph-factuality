Manchester City are keen to sign Anderlecht teenager Evangelos Patoulidis . The 14-year-old playmaker is regarded as one of the best talents to emerge from Anderlecht 's youth set-up and has also attracted attention from Arsenal and Barcelona . The Belgian starlet rejected a move to Barcelona 's La Masia academy when he was 12 as his family wanted him to continue his studies . He has continued to impress and City have held discussions with Anderlecht chairman Roger Vanden Stock in the hope of agreeing a compensation package . Manuel Pellegrini is looked to build for the future by snapping up hot property Evangelos Patoulidis .
