South Africa players celebrate a goal during the 2010 World Cup , but their warm-up games are under suspicion . No players were implicated , but referees were suspected of working for convicted match-fixer Wilson Raj Perumal and manipulating matches . Mbalula has previously expressed frustration with FIFA over delays in the investigation . South African sports minister Fikile Mbalula is frustrated that the report has taken so long to produce .
