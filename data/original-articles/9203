Reid added : ` One of the reasons -LRB- I signed -RRB- was that I could see myself as an important part of the squad for the next six years of my career . ` My family are happy here ; I have a good relationship with the people at the club and most importantly I wanted to give something back to a club that took a chance on me . ` I took all those factors into consideration and footballing-wise I really do believe we can achieve something . ` I am not saying we are going to win the league , that 's probably not realistic , but to win something and get into that upper tier would be an achievement .
