Neither player broke serve in a highly competitive first set , which was only decided when Giorgi 's forehand clipped the top of the net on Williams ' first set point . Williams improved to 19-0 this year and 15-0 for her career in Fed Cup . The only blemish on Williams ' record this year came when she withdrew before the Indian Wells semifinals last month with a knee injury . Serena Williams handed USA the lead against Italy with a first victory in the Fed Cup . The world No 1 shakes hands with US captain Mary Joe Fernandez after putting USA ahead . The second match in the best-of-five series featured 57th-ranked American Lauren Davis playing No. 15 Sara Errani . The winner returns to the World Group and can compete for the Fed Cup trophy next year while the loser will be relegated to the World Group II . Giorgi was a surprise choice by captain Corrado Barazzutti for Italy 's second singles spot over Brindisi-born Flavia Pennetta but the 23-year-old showed surprising poise and was even able to match Williams ' power in the opening set . Williams defeated Camila Giorgi 7-6 , 6-2 on the clay in Brindisi , Italy . Williams was matched shot for shot by Giorgi in the first set before breaking away in the second . Giorgi matched Williams with 17 winners apiece in the first set - which lasted more than an hour - while Williams committed 18 unforced errors to Giorgi 's 15 . Unable to impose her game , Williams appeared frustrated and kept shouting `` Come on ! '' to herself in angrier and angrier tones as the first set wore on . And she consistently applauded , using one hand and her racket , when Giorgi blasted winners by her . But Williams played solidly in the tiebreaker and then surged ahead early in the second set .
