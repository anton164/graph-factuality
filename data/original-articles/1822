And we still have eight matches to play . ' Mourinho knows the Premier League - a championship more competitive than Italy 's Serie A or Spain 's Primera Division , in his opinion - can throw up twists and turns in the closing weeks . The Blues boss was not surprised to see holders Manchester City slip up at Crystal Palace last Monday to all but end their title hopes . Crystal Palace striker Glenn Murray opened the scoring in the Eagles ' surprise win against Manchester City . Jason Puncheon curls his free kick over the Manchester City wall in Palace 's 2-1 win at home on Monday . Mourinho added : ` This is the Premier League . In other competitions it 's difficult to believe that the top team can lose four , five , six , seven matches . ` In almost every country it 's very difficult for a top team to lose so many matches . ` Here , yes . It 's possible . I 'm not surprised . It 's happening to everybody . Everybody loses matches , everybody loses points . ' Mourinho will hope Chelsea are not among them at Loftus Road .
