A lot of people love us and we love a lot of people in Southampton . ` The people who know us from the club , and were close to us , they know how we are and how we were and we were very honest and very professional and that is difficult to explain for the normal people as they are not involved every day . ` I want to be honest person and do my job . I understand the supporters . We need to accept that if they were upset because we took another way . ` This is not easy for them and difficult to understand the decision . But the decision is done .
