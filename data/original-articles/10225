The body of Kyle Knox has been found near the foot of Ben Nevis three weeks after he disappeared . The body of a missing hiker has been found three weeks after he vanished trying to climb Britain 's highest mountain . Kyle Knox , from London , was last seen alive at the foot of Ben Nevis on March 31 . The 23-year-old was reported missing the following day when he failed to return to his hotel in Fort William . When he vanished people were being urged not to go to Scotland 's mountains unless they had the proper equipment and experience due to the severe weather conditions . The mercury had plunged to minus seven and winds of up to 70mph were recorded in the region . There was also snow on the mountain 's peak . It was believed Kyle , who was not an experienced walker , had attempted to climb the Ben Nevis alone . When he set off on the climb Kyle was wearing dark waterproof trousers , walking boots and a jacket with red flashes on it . Searches of Ben Nevis and the Glen Nevis area of Lochaber were launched after the alarm was raised , with Lochaber Mountain Rescue and a RAF search and rescue helicopter from Lossiemouth being scrambled to the scene . Search and rescue dogs also joined in the hunt for missing Kyle . Rescuers were forced to call off the hunt due to band weather in the Scottish Highlands . Today , a body was recovered by a Royal Navy Helicopter in the Surgeon 's Gully area , to the south east of Ben Nevis . It has been identified as that of Mr Knox and his family have been informed . It was believed that Mr Knox , 23 , of London , was attempting to scale the 4409-ft high peak alone .
