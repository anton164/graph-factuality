Police are investigating claims by a former royal footman that palace aides tried to force him into an orgy , it was revealed yesterday . Christopher Lawler said he was pinned to a chair and groped by a male member of staff on his first day working at Clarence House . The ordeal left him in tears and he left the job the same day . He finally decided to contact palace officials again last year after inquiries began into alleged cover-ups of child sex abuse by a VIP paedophile ring in the 1970s and 80s . Police are investigating claims made by a former royal footman that Clarence House aides tried to force him into an orgy in the 1970s . But his complaints were ignored for months before the police were finally notified , he claims . Mr Lawler , now 64 , said the attempted abuse at the Queen Mother 's London residence happened in January 1978 when he was 27 . He said he was accosted after he walked into a bedroom to look for a pen on his first shift . Two men offered him a drink before two other men joined them -- one a senior member of staff , he said . He was asked if he was gay before a younger man took his trousers off and began performing a sex act on himself . ` That prompted another guy to put his hand on my leg and then he grabbed me , ' he told the Sunday People . ` I was staggered . The younger man then came up behind me and gripped me , holding me in the chair . Mr Lawler worked at Clarence House when the Queen Mother used it as her London residence . ` They were trying to undo my trousers but I managed to jump up and burst out of the room . ' Afterwards , Mr Lawler said he was followed by two men and threatened to keep quiet . A complaint he made that day allegedly drew an angry response from Clarence House -- so he packed his bags immediately . Mr Lawler , a former Port of Liverpool police officer , said he was ` haunted ' by the incident for years . After hearing about the probe into historical cases of child abuse last year he wrote to the Palace , but was twice rebuffed . Months later the complaint was finally passed to Scotland Yard . A retired royal aide , who is now in his 80s , was reportedly interviewed but denied he was involved because he was working for the Queen in Balmoral at the time . Mr Lawler has now been told by the Palace that the Royal Household would work ` exhaustively and co-operatively ' with any police probe . A police spokesman said it would be inappropriate to comment ` as investigations continue ' .
