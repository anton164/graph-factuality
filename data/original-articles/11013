Vesely saw off Bedene 6-1 6-4 to reach the final four and tee up a clash with Spanish veteran Daniel Gimeno-Traver . Aljaz Bedene , who has switched from Slovenia to Great Britain , lost in Casablanca -LRB- not pictured -RRB- . The 21-year-old rising Czech star put paid to Bedene 's good start to life under the official British banner , after the London-based 25-year-old changed nationality last month . Vesely saw off Mikhail Youzhny on Thursday despite all his luggage being lost in transit from Rome and borrowing kit from doubles partner Frantisek Cermak .
