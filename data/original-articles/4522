Karen Bell , 42 , from Hull , has been jailed for 12 months after blackmailing a man for £ 55 and threatening to post videos of their sex trysts online . A mother who blackmailed a lover she met on dating website Plenty of Fish by threatening to post footage online of their sex sessions if she did not receive £ 55 , has been jailed for 12 months . Karen Bell , 42 , from Hull , East Yorkshire , met the man on the dating website and the pair exchanged flirty texts - before meeting up to act out their fantasy in which she spanked him with a pair of trainers . However , Hull Crown Court heard that after their meeting she contacted the man -- who can not be named for legal reasons -- and threatened to post the footage on Facebook unless he paid her £ 25 . She later increased the demands , claiming her son had secretly filmed their tryst and the footage was ready to publish , until she received £ 55 . Bell has now been jailed for 12 months after pleading guilty to blackmail . The court heard that the pair began chatting after meeting on free dating site Plenty of Fish and arranged to meet . The man , who was referred to in court as ` Mr A ' , began lending Bell money as she claimed she was short of cash . Stephen Welch , prosecuting , said : ` Some time in December last year , the complainant and the defendant engaged in sexual activity at the defendant 's home address . ` The nature of it was that the complainant removed his trousers and pants and lay on his stomach while the defendant remained fully clothed . ` She spanked the victim on the bottom with a hand , then with a training shoe . ` This was some sort of sexual fantasy the two discussed before the act took place . ` A while later the defendant contacted the complainant and told him her son had installed a hidden camera and their role play had been recorded . ' The couple met on free dating website Plenty Of Fish -LRB- pictured -RRB- and met up after starting up a conversation . Bell , a mother , was jailed for 12 months at Hull Crown Court -LRB- pictured -RRB- after pleading guilty to blackmail . Bell sent Mr A more messages informing him the recording had been put on a DVD and that she was ` sitting watching it with her son ' , the court heard . She told him that if he did not want his friends and family to see the film he should pay her and initially demanded £ 25 . The court heard he was worried and Bell told him if he stopped paying her she would publish the DVD on local websites and on Facebook . Bell -LRB- pictured -RRB- pleaded guilty to blackmail last week . Mr Welch added : ` He was frightened . He believed the defendant would carry out those threats and did n't want his family or friends to see the footage . ' Although he had willingly given her some money , he eventually reported Bell to the police and the total amount she gained by the blackmail was £ 55 , the court was told . When Bell was arrested , she told police in an interview that she ` did n't find the victim sexually attractive but they got on well as friends . ' Stephen Robinson , mitigating before Judge Paul Watson QC , said : ` The defendant moved to Hull from the Grimsby area in order to better herself and start a new life - getting into this sort of serious trouble was the last thing she expected to happen . ` She was lonely and met the complainant through a dating website and began communicating with him . ` Your honour , unfortunately it culminated in this particular offence . ' Jailing Bell for 12 months , Judge Watson told her : ` The money you were demanding was not the highest amount - just £ 55 - but for him that was significant . ` Blackmail is so serious that only a custodial sentence can be justified .
