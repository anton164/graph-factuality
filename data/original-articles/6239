Southampton fear Nathaniel Clyne has already decided his future lies elsewhere as he continues to stall on a new contract . The England right-back enters the final year of his current deal at the end of the season and is yet to agree fresh terms . The Saints are in talks with the defender 's representatives over an extension , with those discussions reaching a crucial stage . Southampton right-back Nathaniel Clyne -LRB- left -RRB- is stalling over a new contract at the club and could leave . Clyne , who is highly-rated , has attracted interest from several top clubs including Manchester Untied . But Sportsmail can reveal it is looking increasingly likely that Clyne will reject a new deal at St Mary 's in search of a move to a Champions League club this summer . Southampton executive director Les Reed , who has been dealing with the contract negotiations , knows there will be a clamour for Clyne 's signature ahead of next season . Manchester United , Chelsea and Liverpool are all interested in the 24-year-old . The trio are able to offer Clyne a more lucrative wage package , and , more pertinently , the prospect of Champions League football next season . Southampton are willing to make Clyne one of the best paid players at the club , offering him a new deal worth Â£ 45,000-per-week . But the south coast club know they can not compete with the likes of United and Chelsea with regard to wages and feel his mind to leave is already made up . The Saints will actively look to sell Clyne this summer if he does not sign a new deal to avoid losing him for nothing in 2016 . Clyne has been at Southampton since 2012 and has established himself as one of the club 's key players . Clyne has won four senior England caps so far and would require a big transfer fee were he to move away .
