A Brazilian online football store claims to have next season 's Chelsea kit for sale on its website - and it can be purchased with Gareth Bale 's name on the back . The website has published three Chelsea kits with the incoming ` Yokohama ' sponsor across the front , albeit without the Adidas emblem , the club 's kit manufacturer . But perhaps most bizarrely , or interestingly from the perspective of Chelsea supporters , the alleged new kit can be bought with ` Bale 9 ' on the back . A Brazilian website is claiming to have the new Chelsea kit for sale , with Gareth Bale 's name on the back . Bale -LRB- centre -RRB- has struggled at Real Madrid this season and reports have linked him with a return to England . The website has the new sponsor on the front of the kits but not the Adidas emblem . Bale 's struggles at Real Madrid have been well documented , with fans and the Spanish media casting him as the man to blame as Ancelotti 's stuttering side have been replaced atop La Liga by Barcelona . Reports both in England and Spain have linked the Wales international with a return to the Premier League . Skeptical Chelsea supporters who wish to purchase the kit without Bale 's name on the back may also want to avoid getting one with a mention of Didier Drogba . Drogba 's Chelsea deal expires at the end of the season and he has not yet signed a new contract . Drogba shirts can be bought despite his uncertain future , while Chelsea 's away shirt -LRB- right -RRB- is also for sale . Drogba rejoined Chelsea on a one-year contract in July 2014 and is yet to be offered a new deal at Stamford Bridge . Chelsea lead the Premier League by six points and have eight games remaining . Jose Mourinho 's side play Stoke in Saturday 's late kick-off .
