Christian Benteke believes it would be risky to suggest Aston Villa can be safe from relegation with one more victory . The Belgian striker , back to form under manager Tim Sherwood with eight goals in six games , said his side must continue to stretch their lead over the drop zone . Villa are six points clear of Queens Park Rangers in 18th but the gap could close this weekend with Burnley and Leicester in Premier League action and Sherwood 's team in the FA Cup semi-final . Christian Benteke rises above Fererico Fazio to head the winning goal for Aston Villa against Tottenham . Benteke points to the skies in celebration after scoring his eighth goal in six matches . Benteke said : ` The more the better , I think it 's risky to say we can take three points and we 're finished . We have to try to win every game . ` Saturday was a massive three points because now we 're six points clear of QPR so it 's very important for us to be far off them . ' Benteke , 24 , said the match against Brendan Rodgers ' team at Wembley was the biggest of his career . ` For the moment , yes , ' he said . ` It -LRB- missing the World Cup -RRB- was hard but now it 's in the past , I 'm looking forward to playing the semi final . Benteke thinks it would be risky to think that one more win will be enough to ensure survival . ` Liverpool are a good team but the thing with the FA Cup is it 's still something special . It 's 50-50 for me but some will say they are favourites . ` Wembley is something good and special because it 's a semi final , it 's close to the final and we have to do everything to be there again . ' Benteke believes his partnership with Gabby Agbonalhor can destroy defences . He added : ` He -LRB- Sherwood -RRB- said to the team we have to play to our strengths , to play with me and Gabby . ` He helped me to destroy the defenders , with two we 're always better than one . I 'm comfortable , it 's a good partnership . '
