Andres Iniesta concedes that he has been unhappy with his form for Barcelona this season , despite receiving praise for his role in killing off Paris Saint-Germain in the UEFA Champions League this week . The Spaniard played a pivotal part in setting up Neymar for the opening goal in the Catalan club 's 2-0 second-leg win over PSG on Tuesday night at the Camp Nou , running from his own half before laying the ball on a plate for the Brazilian forward . Iniesta was typically modest about his fourth assist in Europe this season , preferring to focus on what has been a disappointing domestic campaign for the World Cup winner , in which he is yet to score or create a goal . Andres Iniesta is kept under close watch by the Paris Saint-Germain defenders during Tuesday night 's game . Iniesta perfectly times his pass through to Neymar for the first goal against PSG at the Camp Nou . Barcelona 's No 8 goes to celebrate with Neymar after killing off the French side in the opening half . ` I 'm happy with the way it worked out , ' Iniesta told AS in reference to his latest assist . ` The truth is that it was a nice , fast and improvised run , but it 's good that it resulted in a goal for Neymar . ` Personally , though , I think I have room for improvement . I 'm unsatisfied with my form right now . ' Despite Iniesta 's qualms with his own personal contribution , the 30-year-old is content with how the rest of Luis Enrique 's side are currently performing , with Barcelona top of La Liga by two points and adding a Champions League semi-final berth to the Copa del Rey final date with Athletic Bilbao on May 30 . ` We 're feeling very good going into the decisive stretch of the season , ' the World Cup winner stated . ` We could have 10 games left and we will play them all with a positive attitude . ' Barcelona face city rivals Espanyol at the Estadi Cornella-El Prat on Saturday looking to extend their lead at the top of La Liga , and Iniesta anticipates a difficult task at the home of their neighbours . ` I do not think that the derby is a war , ' the 30-year-old added . ` But it will be a special and tough game . ` I hope things go well and we get the victory .
