While sunseekers across Britain have been making the most of the clear skies recently to soak up some sunshine , the lack of clouds has also proved a bonus for stargazers in Scotland hoping to catch sight of shooting stars . This incredible image was captured above Pitcaple in Aberdeenshire yesterday as photographer Graeme Whipps picked up two meteors which were part of the Lyrid meteor shower . The annual celestial event has been observed for the last 2,700 years across the globe , but is most visible in the northern hemisphere , and is expected to peak tonight with between 10 and 20 meteors an hour .

Stunning : Graeme Whipps captured this image of the Lyrid meteor shower in the skies above Pitcaple in Aberdeenshire yesterday . The strength of the showers vary from year to year and most years there are no more than five to 20 meteors an hour , but in 1982 Americans counted nearly 100 an hour and in 1803 it was as high as 700 an hour . The Lyrids are created by debris from comet Thatcher , which takes about 415 years to orbit around the Sun , and appear to radiate outwards from a star known as Vega and the constellation Lyra in which it sits - which gives the meteors their name . Mr Whipps , a 50-year-old meteorologist , said : ` I was out photographing the sky and saw the meteor , which was amazing . ' While the Lyrid shower has been known to produce up to 100 meteors sightings per hour , most years the peak , which occurs tonight , only produces between five and 20 per hour -LRB- the Lyrid shower pictured from space -RRB- .
