Oldham Athletic have signed Ronaldo . But fans of Manchester United fear not - the League One club have not snaffled their old boy from the mighty Real Madrid . The man in question is 16-year-old Ronaldo Brown who has joined the Latics after being released by Liverpool . Like his namesake , the teenager has explosive pace and plays on the wing . Ronaldo Brown -LRB- left -RRB- , pictured on tour of the Nou Camp in Barcelona , has signed for Oldham Athletic . The 16-year-old is named after Brazil 's former striker Ronaldo , who is pictured scoring in the 2002 World Cup . But he is actually named after the original Brazilian Ronaldo , rather than Portugal star Cristiano . Football-mad mum Denise , 38 , chose the name because of her love of the Brazil side - and added that Ronaldo has a twin brother called Rivaldo . Denise , from Fallowfield , Manchester , explained : ` I love football and the boys were born in 1998 - the year of the World Cup . I liked the Brazil side so I named them after Ronaldo and Rivaldo . ` They also have a younger sister called Trezeguet after the French player -LRB- David -RRB- . ' Long-suffering Oldham fans , whose team has remained in League One for 18 years , can look forward to one day seeing Ronaldo strutting his stuff at Boundary Park . An Oldham source joked : ` With a new stand about to open we thought we would make a marquee signing to mark the occasion . ' Young Brown also has a brother called Rivaldo , after the former Barcelona and AC Milan player . Oldham 's newest signing also has a younger sister called Trezeguet , named after the former French striker .
