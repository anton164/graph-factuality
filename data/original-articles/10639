Stuart Pearce believes Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini deserves more time to turnaround the club 's dwindling fortunes . City 's challenge for the title has capitulated in recent weeks and Pellegrini 's men now face a battle to even finish in the top four . A derby day thumping at the hands of rivals Manchester United only compounded their misery , but Pearce believes City should stick with the 61-year-old . Stuart Pearce believes Manuel Pellegrini should be given more time to turn Manchester City around . The look of dejection on the faces of the Manchester City players has been a familiar sign this season . Pearce told talkSPORT : ` The club is at a stature now where they look to continually be in the Champions League and win Premier Leagues . The club will have a good look at themselves in the summer , but I 'm not a big favour of turning managers over quickly . `` I hope the manager stays in place . He has been around the block long enough to realise the squad needs freshening up drastically this summer . '' Yaya Toure has had a largely ineffective season for current champions Manchester City this season . Toure and Fernandinho look dejected during the Premier League defeat to Manchester United at Old Trafford . Pearce , who spent time at the club as both a manager and a player , blamed City 's poor run of form on the fading influence of Ivorian Yaya Toure . ` Where City have suffered historically is when Toure has either lost form or been away on African Nations tours , '' said Pearce . Sergio Aguero has been a rare shining light in Manchester City 's under performing squad this season .
