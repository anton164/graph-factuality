An obedient pooch showed off its athleticism by completing press-ups with a twist alongside a dog trainer . The dog named Teeny is captured on video sat opposite Eric Ko -- a trainer with over ten years ' experience -- of the Dogaroo centre in Hong Kong . The pair hold onto push-up bars with their front paws and hands respectively and wait for the trainer 's command before getting into position . Looking up at Eric in excitement , the dog waits for the trainer to say ` one ' and complete a press-up before following suit and completing one of its own . On ` two ' the pair return to their original position before Eric says ` three ' and ` four ' and the dog reaches out to high-five him with both paws . Eric then says ` kiss ' and the dog leans towards him and gives him a quick peck on the lips before the pair begin the routine again . The dog looks up at the trainer in excitement and waits for him to say ` one ' before starting . Repeating the process twice more , the dog maintains its level of concentration and acts upon every command as intended . The video concludes with Eric saying : ` Come on Teeny you can do it , ' as the pair continue to complete more press-ups . Dogaroo is a luxury pet service that has both training facilities as well as a hotel for dogs . The trainer and the dog begin their workout and complete a press-up together to the count of four . After a count of four the dog named Teeny leans out and gives the trainer named Eric Ko a kiss . According to their Facebook page , the trainers at the centre obtained their qualifications from Australian . And they provide everything from obedience behavioural training to behaviour modification at the Dogaroo centre . At the luxury hotel there is a day care service , a professional pet grooming service and a swimming pool and playground . The video concludes with the trainer speaking to the dog encouragingly before they carry on working out .
