The former Top Gear presenter made his comments when he was guest of honour at a charity auction in the Cotswolds . Opening the auction in aid of Chipping Norton 's lido , he said : ` In the olden days when I used to work for BBC , I could n't say s *** - but I am not , so I will say s *** .

Hundreds of fans paid £ 15 a ticket to watch Clarkson oversee the auction at Chipping Norton town Hall . He also joked about ` trawling the job centre ' for a hosting job when he spotted an opening for the charity auction . In a typical Clarkson moment , he mistook a male bidder for a female but responded by saying : ` I have worked with James May , it is easy to get confused in these situations . ' Clarkson , who celebrates his 55th birthday tomorrow , previously lived in a sprawling £ 900,000 house one mile outside the town . It was his first public appearance since he was sacked from the BBC for allegedly assaulting a producer in the now infamous row over a steak supper in a Yorkshire hotel . He was accused of punching producer Oisin Tymon following a day 's filming . Clarkson was due to make his TV comeback as guest host of BBC1 's Have I Got News for You on April 23 but he pulled out of the show two weeks before it was due to be filmed .
