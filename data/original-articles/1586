Scott Dann was a fraction offside when he set up Glenn Murray for Palace 's first goal -LRB- 2 -RRB- , but it would be harsh to put too much blame on assistant John Brooks . He was spot on with two equally tight calls in the same move -- before Dann got the ball -LRB- 1 -RRB- and for Murray 's finish -LRB- 3 -RRB- . The speed of it , plus two players blocking his view , made it unbelievably hard for him to get all three right .
