Relegation-threatened Romanian club Ceahlaul Piatra Neamt have sacked Brazilian coach Ze Maria for the second time in a week . Former Brazil defender Ze Maria was fired on Wednesday after a poor run , only to be reinstated the next day after flamboyant owner Angelo Massone decided to ` give the coaching staff another chance . ' But the 41-year-old former Inter Milan and Parma right back , capped 25 times by Brazil , angered Massone again after Ceahlaul were beaten 2-0 by mid-table FC Botosani on Saturday . Ze Maria represented Brazil on 25 occasions during an international career spanning five years . The result left Ceahlaul 16th in the standings , six points adrift of safety . Ze Maria replaced Florin Marin in January to become Ceahlaul 's third coach this season . He will be replaced by Serbian Vanya Radinovic .
