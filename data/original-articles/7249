At the grand old age of 75 , Jack Nicklaus is still capable of hitting aces . The Golden Bear added another magic moment to his storied career at Augusta National in the Par-3 Contest . Stepping up to the tee on the 130-yard fourth , the greatest golfer of all time saw his shot sail beyond the flag before spinning back into the hole . Jack Nicklaus gave the crowd something to cheer with a hole in one on the fourth during the Par-3 Contest . Nicklaus holds up his ball to an adoring crowd as Gary Player -LRB- left -RRB- and Ben Crenshaw salute the great . Crenshaw and Nicklaus fist pump following his ace on the 130-yard hole at Augusta National . Nicklaus was playing alongside Gary Player and Ben Crenshaw as the first roar of Masters week filled the skies in a sunswept Georgia . ` I had an interview this morning , and I said `` well , all I 've got to do is go out and win the Par-3 and make a hole and one '' , and I make a hole in one , ' Nicklaus said afterwards . The ace was Nicklaus ' first on the hallowed turf of Augusta , but the veteran saw his achievement eclipsed by that of Camilo Villegas on a day which saw five hole-in-ones , levelling the record from 2002 . The Colombian followed Nicklaus with an ace on the fourth and also managed one on the eighth , but he could n't quite land the title , losing out to world No 74 Kevin Streelman in a play-off . Nicklaus became the youngest person to wear a green jacket in 1963 , and collected his sixth in 1986 . He is one of five men to complete the career grand slam , an accolade which favourite Rory McIlroy can achieve if he wins his third major in succession .
