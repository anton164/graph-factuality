Southend United 's promotion charge continued on Tuesday night at Bury when a David Worrall free-kick enabled them to leapfrog their hosts into fourth place . Former Bury player Worrall struck from 25 yards in the 74th minute with a superb curling effort from a set-piece courtesy of a yellow-carded foul by Adam El-Abd . It put manager Phil Brown 's late-goal specialists , who pinched an added-time winner at Exeter on Saturday , behind third-placed Wycombe only on goal difference . Phil Brown 's Southend United move into fourth after a 1-0 win over Bury on Tuesday night . While Bury dominated for long spells , Brown 's men were rarely in trouble . Bury began the night a point ahead of the Shrimpers after winning 1-0 at Portsmouth on Saturday but despite chances they could n't hit the target . They were backed by one of their biggest crowds of the season - 8,396 - having offered free entry after the initial fixture was postponed . Less than 10 minutes was played of the first attempt at the match in March but the open gates saw the club enjoy its biggest home crowd for almost 18 years . A saved from Southend keeper Daniel Bentley from Ryan Lowe late in proceedings ensured his side 's seventh clean sheet in a row .
