Field Marshall Erwin Rommel sporting his famous goggles which were in fact a five from British Major General Michael Gambier-Parry . He was the one German leader in the Second World War who the British regarded with honour . Field Marshal Erwin Rommel gained respect from his foes for his tactical acumen and sense of fairness during the battle for North Africa . Rommel , nicknamed the Desert Fox , also became an iconic wartime figure -- and the stylish goggles he famously wore across his peak cap became part of the myth . Now the story of how the German came to be in possession of the goggles can be told for the first time . They were given to him by a British prisoner as a gift to thank him for retrieving a stolen hat . Major General Michael Gambier-Parry , of the 2nd Armoured Division , was captured with 2,000 of his men by Rommel in Mechili , Libya , in 1941 . The German field marshal invited the British officer to dine with him in a gesture of military camaraderie . The pair shared good wine and smoked ` excellent cigars ' , according to Gambier-Parry 's granddaughter , Liza Donoghue , 67 . During the meal , Gambier-Parry complained that a German soldier had taken his hat . A furious Rommel then took it upon himself to get the garment back to his prisoner . And when Rommel later found Gambier-Parry 's Army goggles in a staff car , he asked the British officer if he could keep them and Gambier-Parry agreed . Scroll down for video .
