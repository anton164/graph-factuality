A lonely shepherd has been found dead alongside a scarecrow he had apparently had sex with after dressing it up in a long-haired wig and lipstick . The rotting remains of Jose Alberto , 58 , were discovered after neighbours called their local council to report the smell coming from his house in the city of San Jose de Balcare in eastern Argentina . Rodolfo Moure , a spokesman for the prosecutor 's office , said : ` I initially thought there were two bodies but then I realised one was a scarecrow wearing lipstick and a long-haired wig . Jose Alberto , 58 , was found dead next to a scarecrow prosecutors believe he died while having sex with it . ` It was lying next to the deceased . ` There were no signs of violence and we are working on the assumption that the man died during sex with the scarecrow . ` Straw had been stuffed inside the old clothes that had been sewn together to make the scarecrow . ` We are now waiting the results of an autopsy .
