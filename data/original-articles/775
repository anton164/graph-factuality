Daniel Levy reportedly told the Tottenham Hotspur Supporters ' Trust that after the problems reinvesting the money received for Gareth Bale , future transfer policy would entail the purchase of young players , priced between £ 10-15million with good potential for resale . This may be financially sensible , but it is hardly reassuring . Elite clubs , those who challenge for the biggest trophies , do not buy with one eye on selling and this strategy would set Tottenham back a decade to a time when they helped solve problems at Manchester United by trading top performers such as Michael Carrick and Dimitar Berbatov . Indeed , the only time Tottenham demonstrated real Champions League potential was when Levy resisted the likes of Chelsea over Luka Modric . Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy is planning a new transfer policy for the club that centres on resale value . Spurs sold forward Gareth Bale -LRB- left -RRB- to Real Madrid in 2013 for a world-record £ 85 million transfer fee . Spurs ' best chance of securing regular Champions League football came when Luka Modric played for them . Spurs allowed star performers Dimitar Berbatov -LRB- left -RRB- and Michael Carrick -LRB- right -RRB- to join Manchester United . The moment they started to sell again , Tottenham fell away . Not even having the Premier League 's top goalscorer in Harry Kane has placed them among the elite again -- and it is hard to see how that will change if this is the plan . Nobody overtakes Manchester United by offering a helping hand -- no matter how favourable the price . Even the exploits of Premier League top goalscorer Harry Kane has n't been enough to get Spurs top-four .
