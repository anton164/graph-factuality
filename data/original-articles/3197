Chelsea could move for Atletico Madrid centre back Miranda in the summer . The club 's technical director Michael Emenalo travelled to Spain on Saturday to watch the defender during Atletico 's 2-2 draw with Malaga , according to Spanish newspaper AS . The 31-year-old has one year left on his contract and Atletico are reportedly keen to cash in this summer .

Miranda has also been offered to Manchester United and Manchester City , but both clubs are more interested in the Brazilian 's team-mates Diego Godin and Jose Maria Gimenez . Chelsea and Atletico held talks over Miranda last summer when Jose Mourinho 's side moved to sign Diego Costa and Felipe Luis , but the defender rejected a move to London -- as well as United -- to remain in Madrid . But the presence of Costa and Luis at Stamford Bridge coupled with the emergence of Gimenez as a regular at Atletico may convince Miranda to join Chelsea this time around . Miranda currently has a year left on his contract and has yet to agree a new deal with the Spanish side . Earlier in the month , however , Miranda rejected talk that he would leave Atletico . Asked about speculation linking him with a move to Old Trafford , Miranda told Brazilian website Estadao : ` Of course this news reaches me , and it makes me happy . It shows I am doing well . ` It makes me proud , but my intention is to stay at Atletico because I still have a year and a half on my contract . ' The emergence of defender Jose Maria Gimenez at Atletico may influence Miranda 's decision this summer .
