Christian Benteke has revealed a secret . Despite what appeared cast-iron evidence to the contrary , he does not practise free-kicks . He has taken only a handful in his career . Yet with seven minutes to go in a game Aston Villa dared not lose , he stepped forward , pushing aside team-mates , to curl his dead-ball opportunity over the Queens Park Rangers wall and into the net . Precious point rescued . ` I surprised myself ! ' he says , laughing . ` When I saw it , Charles N'Zogbia said , `` I want to shoot '' . But I said , `` I want to take it '' . Christian Benteke bends a free-kick over the QPR wall to rescue a point for Aston Villa last week . Benteke jumps for joy after sealing his hat-trick in the relegation battle with QPR at Villa Park . The Belgium striker admitted he even surprised himself by finding the back of the net with the free kick . ` It was n't about the hat-trick , it was more about if I can take the free-kick or not , if I can hit the target . I have only taken one before for Villa , against Swansea , and I hit the post . ' What happens should a chance come from similar range against Liverpool ? ` I 'll take it . Sometimes you have to try . ' So speaks a striker of soaring confidence . Eight goals in his last six games , the latest a towering header to take all three points at Tottenham , Benteke is bang in form and relishing the prospect of an FA Cup semi-final . Sitting to discuss the match in a dressing room at Villa 's Bodymoor Heath training complex , he looks as if he would like to be on Wembley 's turf post-haste . He has been rejuvenated under Tim Sherwood , scoring a goal every 87 minutes since the new Villa manager took over . The unnerving thing for Liverpool is that he says he will get better . Benteke rises above Fererico Fazio to head the winning goal for Aston Villa against Tottenham on Saturday . Benteke points to the sky in celebration after scoring his eighth goal in six matches . Benteke is in the kind of form which could see Tim Sherwood 's Villa escape from Premier League relegation . ` I still think I can do more , in everything , ' he insists . ` I ca n't say I 'm happy to be there now , I want to do more and more . ' That insatiable appetite is understandable after a disheartening year , starved first of football , then chances . It was April 3 , 2014 , when a loud crack was heard across Bodymoor 's training pitches signalling Benteke 's ruptured achilles . His World Cup dream was over . Parents Jean-Pierre and Marie-Claire cancelled their tickets to Brazil . Six months of rehabilitation followed before Benteke 's return last October . A red card on his third start against Tottenham kept him out for another brief period . There was a splendid goal at Crystal Palace , then another against Manchester United . A third came against Blackpool in the FA Cup third round . Dazzlingly good , but these strikes were isolated . Benteke never appeared his barnstorming self . His movement was limited , his impact negligible . Villa 's safety-first style was a significant factor . Often Benteke looked cut adrift up front . The nadir came when Paul Lambert dropped him to the bench for the visit of Chelsea in February . ` It was frustrating because I knew I could do better , ' he says , reflecting on that moment . ` Every time after the game I said to myself , `` I can do better '' . It was frustrating to play a game with no chances . But I am not that guy who is going to complain . I understood the situation . ' Sherwood 's impact has been immediate . Just as he did with Emmanuel Adebayor at Tottenham , he has taken a misfiring striker and recalibrated the shooting . Sherwood 's tactics are tailored to Benteke and his relentless positivity has awoken the inner beast . Benteke was forced to watch Belgium reach the quarter-final of the World Cup after rupturing his achilles . Benteke praised the impact of new manager Sherwood for playing a style that suits the striker 's attributes . ` He has given me a lot of freedom and he has said to the other lads to play maybe more direct with me , ' explains Benteke . ` When a manager says that , you feel more important , more responsible . ` The way that we play now is comfortable for me because I 'm scoring and also for the team because I help the team . ' He is excited about his partnership with Gabby Agbonlahor . ` He helps me destroy the defenders . With two we 're always better than one . ' Benteke is grateful to Lambert for bringing him to Villa from Genk in 2012 but acknowledges it was the correct call to sack the manager . ` That 's a tough question , ' he pauses . ` I will say yes because the confidence of the team was a little bit low and when the gaffer came he brought the confidence up . ' Benteke believes his fitness after such a long time out was an issue too but now he feels in peak condition . ` I play like I used to before . I feel really good . ' Those summer weeks when he could only watch his nation 's World Cup adventure on TV are becoming a distant , if difficult , memory . Benteke is delighted with the partnership he has struck up with fellow striker Gabby Agbonlahor . The striker paid tribute to former manager Paul Lambert for signing him from Genk in 2012 . ` It was tough , ' he says . ` I worked hard for that opportunity . But that 's life . The manager Marc Wilmots said , `` If you want , you can come with the lads . '' But I did n't . I came back to Belgium and my family helped get me through . My mum said , `` You have to be thankful to God , it could have been worse '' . ' Becoming a father to baby Jayden last September put things in perspective . ` It was good , I forgot about my injury , ' he says , smiling . Doubts about his talent emerged during his troubles but he has faced down critics before . Three years ago Genk dismissed his Premier League credentials . ` They said I was n't ready because the level between Belgium and England is really high and I should stay one more season . But I said , `` No , I am confident , I want to go '' . I do n't really listen to what people say . If I feel it , I just do it . But Benteke concedes that sacking Lambert was the correct decision after the lift Sherwood has given them . Chelsea midfielder and compatriot Eden Hazard tweeted his admiration for Benteke after his Spurs winner . ` It was my dream to play in the best league . I was a fan of Arsenal . ' He insists he is not dreaming of scoring at Wembley . ` I do n't want a dream , I want to do it . ' He is not that close to compatriot Simon Mignolet but is good friends with Marouane Fellaini and Eden Hazard . ` I have known them since I was really young . ' Hazard tweeted his admiration following Benteke 's goal at Spurs . ` He is my brother , like you say . For me , he deserves to be the Player of the Year . ' Benteke will consider what he deserves in the summer . Wolfsburg have been keeping tabs on him . ` Since I came I have had a lot of pressure here , ' he says . ` If I want to one day , after say four or five years , be with the big club , then it is pressure every time also . ' He ultimately wants European football . That will come for Villa by reaching the final , should Arsenal also qualify . ` I think this is the beauty of the FA Cup , now everything is possible , ' he says .
