Liverpool defender Martin Skrtel has rejected rumours linking him with a move away from Anfield by declaring he wo n't be leaving the Premier League side . The Slovakia international has made over 200 league appearances for the Reds since arriving in 2008 but has recently been linked with a summer switch switch to Wolfsburg and Napoli . However , Skrtel has rejected a potential move elsewhere and has said his future remains at Liverpool despite his contract expiring in 2016 . Martin Skrtel -LRB- left -RRB- has been linked with a move to Bundesliga side Wolfsburg and Serie A outfit Napoli . The Liverpool defender played in his side 's 2-1 FA Cup semi-final defeat to Aston Villa on Sunday . ` I am not leaving anywhere . Not to Wolfsburg nor to Naples , ' he told the Liverpool Echo . Liverpool have endured yet another disappointing campaign this season and are expected to have a clear-out in the summer as they target silverware . But Skrtel 's agent Karol Csonto has confirmed it 's unlikely the 30-year-old will leave Anfield as he prepares to finalise a new contract . ` The only offer which is lying on Martin Skrtel 's table right now is the extension of his contract from Liverpool , ' he said . ` We have been working on the details , and we will be finalising it soon . ` It is not true that he has some offer from the German club . I do n't know anything even about their interest . ' Skrtel , pictured above battling with Villa striker Christian Benteke at Wembley , has rejected the rumours . The 30-year-old has made over 200 league appearances for the Reds since arriving at Anfield in 2008 .
