Eight San Francisco police officers accused of sending racist and homophobic text messages have been suspended , and the police chief is recommending that the veteran employees be sacked . Chief Greg Suhr announced in a statement Friday that he has asked a police oversight committee to approve firing the officers . He called the texts ` despicable ' and says those who sent them ` clearly fall below the minimum standards required to be a police officer . ' Authorities say that the offensive texts targeting blacks , Mexicans , Filipinos and gay men , which make repeated use of racist and homophobic slurs , were sent between 2011 and 2012 . San Francisco Police Chief Greg Suhr -LRB- pictured -RRB- said that eight officers had been suspended and that he had recommended they be fired . Texts between San Francisco Police Department officers included racist , sexist and homophobic messages . Suhr says six others will face disciplinary actions that include reassignment to positions that do n't have contact with the public . The messages were discovered by federal authorities investigating former sergeant Ian Furminger , who was convicted of corruption and sentenced to 41 months in prison . ` All n ***** s must f ***** g hang ' and ` N ***** s must be spayed ' were among the texts uncovered . ` It 's not against the law to put an animal down , ' an officer said , referring to a black man in Furminger 's house . Other texts were offensive to women and repeatedly used the word f ** . The eight officers include Captain Jason Fox , 42 , a two decade veteran and Sergeant Michael Wibunsin , a 12-year veteran , according to the San Francisco Chronicle 's sources . Officers identified as Michael Robison , 46 , a 23-year-veteran , Noel Schwab , 49 , a 16-year-veteran and Michael Celis , who has been on the force for 16 years , have reportedly already resigned or said they will resign . Sean Doherty , an 11-year veteran and Rain Daugherty , a 15-year-officer , are also facing termination . Robison , Schwab and Celis have reportedly already resigned . Michael Robison , 46 , a 23-year veteran of the force , has resigned . He gave an interview to the Advocate in 1999 -LRB- pictured -RRB- about being a gay officer . He said ` the `` good ol' boys '' system is on its way out ' The offensive text messages were uncovered after federal corruption charges were brought against former SFPD sergeant Ian Furminger , who was sentenced to 41 months in prison last month . The eighth officer has not yet been identified , and was not aware about possible dismissal as of Friday . Robison is openly gay and told the LGBT magazine The Advocate in 1998 : ` The `` good ol' boys '' system is on its way out , and the newer generation that 's replaced them sees things from a more open-minded standpoint ' He was accused of using a racial epithet against a suspect in the mid 1990s but the allegation was dismissed . In 2007 an officer named Jason Fox was accused of hitting a gay man 's head against the wall and using his hair to clean up urine on the street outside a club . ` Do you think we want your AIDS-infected pee on our streets ? ' Fox allegedly said . He did not face police department discipline in the case because the statute of limitations had passed . Police commissioners at the time reached a $ 83,000 out of court settlement with the gay man . The SFPD did not respond to a request for comment from Daily Mail Online about whether the incident involved the same Jason Fox accused in the text message scandal . San Francisco Public Defender Jeff Adachi said that more than 1,000 cases where the officers testified will need to be reviewed . Minutes from a San Francisco Family Violence Council meeting show that Fox was promoted from lieutenant to captain in 2013 . Celis was suspended in 2004 after an incident when he tried to use his badge and pay a bribe to get into his wife 's hotel room . Wibunsin and several other officers were accused of stealing $ 10,000 while executing a search warrant in 2011 . Public Defender Jeff Adachi said he expects more than 1,000 cases where the officers testified to be reviewed . He has called for the Department of Justice to investigate San Francisco 's police as it did with officers in Ferguson , Missouri , according to KQED .
