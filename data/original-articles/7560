Ronnie O'Sullivan took off his shoes mid-match at the Crucible on Tuesday -- but still socked it to debutant Craig Steadman . The Rocket raced into a 7-2 lead in his first match at this year 's Betfred World Championship in Sheffield . But five-time champion O'Sullivan , 39 , could now face a fine after breaching snooker 's strict dress code against the 32-year-old from Manchester .

O'Sullivan almost made a 147 maximum break in the first frame -- missing the 14th red on a run of 104 . But he played the sixth frame in his socks after removing some new shoes , complaining about a painful big toe . O'Sullivan saw his lead pegged back to 4-2 after losing that frame -- and tried to hand his footwear to a fan . He also asked : ` Does anyone in here have some size eight or nine shoes I can borrow . I 'm serious ? ' But tournament director Mike Ganley summoned him out of the arena and lent him his own shoes for the last three frames of the session .

World Snooker chairman Barry Hearn said : ` The one thing you can be sure of with Ronnie O'Sullivan is that you have absolutely no idea what he is going to do next . ` I would rather he played with his shoes on if it all possible though . And what happens if his trousers are a bit tight in the next session of his match ? ' Meanwhile , Ding Junhui blew the chance to win Â£ 30,000 and become only the seventh player to make a maximum at the Crucible . He incredibly played for the blue after the 13th red following 12 blacks and only gasps from the crowd alerted him to the blunder . Ding looked stunned before a doomed long-distance attempt on the black failed . However , he shrugged off the setback to claim a 10-7 victory . Ding , who now plays John Higgins in the second round , said : ` I was concentrating so hard I forgot . I had been 4-0 behind and doing everything to get back into the match , and already thinking about trying to win the next frame . ` I only realised what I had done after playing for the blue because the crowd reacted . Then I checked the scoreboard . Hopfully one day I will get another chance to make a 147 at the Crucible , but it was a bit embarrassing . ' Ali Carter , a two-time Crucible finalist , looked in good touch in his first match at the venue since being given the all-clear from lung cancer . O'Sullivan took to Twitter to post a picture of his inflamed left ankle back in November 2014 . Following a 10-5 win over Alan McManus to set up a clash with Neil Robertson , he said : ` This is where I feel comfortable and most enjoy playing . I have done everything here except win it and that 's what I am here to do . I did n't want to come here , get some applause , play like an idiot and go home . ' Mark Allen won an incredible nine frames in a row from 3-1 down to blow away Ryan Day 10-3 . The 29-year-old from Northern Ireland , who now plays Barry Hawkins , said : ` That does n't happen very often at this level . But that was my C game . Ryan gave the chances rather than me earning them . I will need to play a lot better to be in the mix for the title . '
