A study reveals that Britons spend an average of £ 62 a week on rewarding themselves , with retail therapy reaching a high at lunchtime today . Treats can range from a bar of chocolate to a glass of wine . And surprisingly , men spend a third more a month than women on treating themselves . They are also more likely to lie about their expenditure and hide items they have purchased from their partners in a desperate quest to keep their shopping habits under wraps , a different survey last year found . The shoppers of Swansea are the most frivolous , with 44 per cent splurging as soon as they are paid , followed by those in Aberdeen -LRB- 42 per cent -RRB- and Belfast -LRB- 39 per cent -RRB- . The most cautious spenders live in Wolverhampton , where only 19 per cent choose to treat themselves on pay day . Designer items -LRB- stock image above -RRB- are also popular buys and men spend a third more a month than women on treating themselves , the research claims . Other research claimed the average Brit spends £ 153 within 24 hours of payday - while 10 per cent splurge more than £ 500 . Some workers said they spend so much in the 24 hours after payday because they had arranged their regular payments and direct debits to leave their accounts around that time . While others said it was because they felt like they deserved the treat .
