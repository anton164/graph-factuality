The Queen has dropped out of the list of the 300 richest people in Britain for the first time , it emerged yesterday . Although her wealth has increased year-on-year , her assets have been dwarfed by hundreds of financiers and businessmen . Britain 's super-rich are now more than twice as rich as they were in 2009 , despite the catastrophic economic crisis . Queen Elizabeth II , pictured at Westminster Abbey yesterday . She placed 302nd on the Sunday Times Rich List with a wealth of £ 340m , compared with 285th last year and putting her outside of the top 300 for the first time . Len Blavatnick , pictured left with his wife Emily , topped the Sunday Times Rich List with a fortune of £ 13.2 bn . Brothers Sri and Gopi Hinduja were pushed into second placed as their wealth was valued at £ 13bn . 1 . Len Blavatnik £ 13.17 billion -LRB- Investment , music and media -RRB- . 2 .

Today the wealthiest 1,000 people based in Britain are collectively worth £ 547billion , up from £ 258billion in 2009 , an increase of 112 per cent . Those placed lowest on the 1,000 rankings have around £ 100million -- £ 45million more than in 2009 and £ 15million more than last year , the biggest annual leap in 18 years . The findings are revealed in this year 's Sunday Times Rich List , which consists of people who are British , who live and work in the UK , or who have ` strong links ' to this country . The Queen 's wealth grew modestly in the last year by £ 10million to £ 340million , leaving her at number 302 -- down from 285 in 2014 . Almost three decades ago , when the list was first compiled , the Queen was placed at the top , with £ 5.2 billion . However , the rules of the list have changed to stop counting the value of assets such as the royal art collection , which could not be described as her personal wealth . Much of the rise in her income recently is down a record year for the Crown Estate in 2013-14 , with profits of £ 267million . Under new financing rules , the 89-year-old monarch receives 15 per cent of the Crown Estate profits via the Sovereign Grant .

Len Blavatnik , a businessman and music mogul born in Ukraine , tops this year 's Rich List with an estimated personal wealth of £ 13.17 billion . The 57-year-old built much of his fortune , which is up £ 3.17 billion on 2014 , from Russian oil in an unlikely alliance with BP , but also bought Warner Music in 2011 and later added Parlophone , the Beatles ' label , to his growing number of interests . The son of two Jewish academics , he emigrated to New York in 1978 and became a US citizen in 1984 . Two years later , he started an investment company , Access Industries , and with Viktor Vekselberg and Mikhail Fridman he gained control of the oil producer TNK , partner of BP . When TNK-BP was sold in 2013 , Blavatnik 's share was more than £ 4billion . Access 's stakes in aluminium producer Rusal and chemicals firm LyondellBasell meant his wealth continued to grow . Blavatnik has two daughters and two sons with his American wife , Emily Appelson . At his 50th birthday party , she surprised him by dancing with a troupe of professionals in a Russian ballet . He owns a £ 41million mansion in London 's Kensington , recently paid $ 77million -LRB- £ 50.7 million -RRB- for a five-bedroom duplex in New York , and has donated £ 75million to Oxford University to found the Blavatnik School of Government .

He may have just missed out on the top 100 , but Lord Sugar is unlikely to be unhappy with his lot after becoming a billionaire for the first time this year . The 68-year-old businessman was ranked 101 in the Rich List for his £ 1.04 billion wealth . Lord Sugar , pictured with Apprentice winner Leah Totton , has £ 700million of real estate , while net profits for Amshold , his holding company , soared to £ 552m in 2013-14 . He was described by The Sunday Times as ` super-boss and master of the acerbic put-down ' on The Apprentice .
