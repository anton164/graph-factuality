Some tour guides will do anything for a good tip . In the Australian outback , if you want to get up-close and personal with a mob of local Emus , you need a guide who will get down and dirty ... apparently . In a video posted online by YouTube user Ratbag Nomad , one man , referred to as Australianwidefishingguide , shows tourists how it 's done . Emus are notoriously curious flightless birds of Australia . As the tour guide started peddling his legs slowly in the air , the mob of emus started coming closer . And closer . The video , filmed from a vehicle on an empty dirt road in the bush , shows the guide lying down on his back and kicking his legs in the air to lure a mob of emus in the distance . Peddling his legs to the sky , he looks like something between an up-side down bicycle rider and a dead cockroach . Sure enough , the Emus - known to be especially curious birds - come close to see what 's going on , then scatter as the guide leaps to his feat . A good leg in the air does the trick . As the guide leapt to his feet , the inquisitive birds scattered . It 's thought to be an old Aboriginal trick to catch an emu - whose meat was highly valued for its oils . Emus belong to the same family of flightless birds as the ostrich and the cassowary . Capable of reaching running speeds of up to 70 km/hour , they 're said to be able to ` run the pants off a Kangaroo . ' The manoeuvre is thought to be an old Aboriginal trick to catch an emu - a bird whose meat was highly valued for its oils but who are too fast to catch on foot .
