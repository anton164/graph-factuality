Mark O'Meara rolled back the years with one of the standout rounds of the day to make the cut at the Masters for the first time in 10 years . The 1998 champion was one over after the first round but five birdies in his second , including three in four holes on the front nine , saw him card a 68 and ensure he will still be in the running at the weekend . The 58-year-old American is the third oldest man in the field in 2015 , behind Tom Watson -LRB- 65 -RRB- and Ben Crenshaw -LRB- 63 -RRB- , but showed excellent form to hit his first round in the 60s at Augusta since 2001 . Mark O'Meara carded a 68 on day two and ensured he will still be in the running at the weekend . O'Meara is the third oldest man in the field in 2015 , behind 65-year-old Tom Watson . O'Meara is also better placed after 36 holes than he was when he won the green jacket in 1998 . On that occasion he was level par for the first two rounds compared to three under this year . But he will have his work cut out if he wants to catch Jordan Spieth , who is 37 years his junior . Ben Crenshaw , aged 63 , is the second oldest golfer competing at the Masters this year .
