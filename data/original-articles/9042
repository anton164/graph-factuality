Police in Argentina are hunting a family-of-six who crammed onto one motorbike before riding through the streets without helmets . They were spotted driving through the city of San Miguel de Tucuman in Argentina 's north-western province of Tucuman . A man was pictured holding the handlebars of the bike while three young children straddled the petrol tank in front of him and a girl and a woman sat on the seat behind him . People carrier : Two adults and four children were pictured riding on the same motorbike in San Miguel de Tucuman , Argentina . It comes just weeks after a similar pictured emerged of a family of seven riding on the same motorbike though the city of Junin in Argentina 's eastern province of Buenos Aires . Describing the most recent case , passer-by Etel Ramirez Nazario , 46 , said : ` It was shocking to see . ` Three little children who could n't be more than three or four were all at the front , the dad was behind them . ` Behind him was another child who I 'd say was about seven or eight and then the mum on the back . ` They were going pretty fast and none of them had helmets . I dread to think what would have happened if they had hit another car or fallen off . ' Police are also hunting a family of seven seen riding on the same motorbike through the city of Junin just weeks ago . The family 's actions were condemned on social media sites after pictures of the incident appeared online in Argentina . One user , Amatista Avalos Muro , wrote : ` This is absolutely unbelievable . These parents are setting their kids up for death . ' Another , Ramses Crespo Cruz , posted : ` So sad that some parents are so irresponsible . Those poor children . ' Police say they are looking for the parents . A spokesman said : ` We have seen the picture and strongly condemn this utterly irresponsible and dangerous behaviour . ` We have appealed for anyone who recognises the family to come forward . '
