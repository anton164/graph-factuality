Mourinho planned for Kurt Zouma to man mark Fellaini - with teenager Ruben Loftus-Cheek playing the 6ft 4in midfielder in training . But he feared his tactical master plan was set to be for nothing when the Chelsea boss was told that the Manchester United man was not playing by the doorman at the club 's hotel .

' -LRB- It -RRB- did n't smell well for me . I go to Google and I put ` Fellaini brother ' . Images . ` So I go with the pictures to the doorman . I say ` hey , this one or this one ? ' And he looks ` this one ' . ` He 's the brother ' .
