Cigars may be more harmful to smokers than cigarettes , researchers warned yesterday . The news comes as cigar use rises in the US , where the study was carried out , and cigarette smoking declines . Alarmingly , more young people appear to be taking up cigars thanks to new ranges of flavoured ones . Researchers have warned that cigars may be more harmful to smokers than cigarettes . They found the risk for cigar smokers of dying from oral , oesophageal or lung cancer was at least as bad as for cigarettes . Cigar consumption more than doubled from 6.2 billion in 2000 to more than 13.7 billion in 2011 -- in contrast with a 33 per cent fall for cigarettes . Researchers analysed 22 studies , including five from Britain , and found the risks for cigar smokers of dying from oral , oesophageal or lung cancer was at least as bad as for cigarettes . They also found that those who smoked cigars and had previously smoked cigarettes had a much higher risk of lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease compared to cigar smokers who had not previously smoked cigarettes . The team said they believed this could be due in part to the inhalation patterns of these different types of cigar smokers . Cindy Chang , of the US Food and Drug Administration , which did the study , said : ` Some risks associated with cigar smoking can be as high or higher than with cigarette smoking . `` Cigar smoking is linked to fatal oral , oesophageal , pancreatic , laryngeal , and lung cancers , as well as heart disease and aortic aneurysm . '' Cigar use is on the rise in the US , where the study was carried out , while cigarette smoking declines . Cigar consumption more than doubled from 2000-2011 -- in contrast with a 33 per cent fall for cigarettes .
