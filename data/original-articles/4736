Yorkshire have signed India international Cheteshwar Pujara until the end of May after cancelling the contract of Younis Khan . Younus was set to be Yorkshire 's overseas signing for 2015 , but the batsman is now looking to be part of Pakistan 's potential touring party to Bangladesh , effectively ruling him out of any playing time in the LV = County Championship . Pujara will instead link up with the Division One champions - subject to receiving a work permit - having spent time at the back end of last season with Derbyshire , scoring 219 championship runs for them . Yorkshire director of cricket Martyn Moxon announced in a statement that Younus made his international intentions clear on Sunday , and added : ` We have moved quickly to bring in Pujara and he is a superb player . Indian batsman Cheteshwar Pujara has joined Yorkshire on a deal until the end of May . ` He is an outstanding young Test cricketer , who is hungry to perform in the English game . In the brief conversations I have had with him , he is very much looking forward to be joining Yorkshire and being part of our plans . ' Pujara , 27 , made his international Test debut in 2010 , and with six centuries in the five-day game is a highly rated part of India 's squad with many seeing him as the natural successor to Rahul Dravid . Pujara , who boasts nearly 9,000 first-class runs , will turn out for Yorkshire until Australian Aaron Finch is free of Indian Premier League commitments with Mumbai Indians . ` I was looking to return to the UK after my previous experience of county cricket , which I greatly enjoyed , and when Yorkshire made the offer I did n't think twice , ' Pujara said . ` To wear the same white rose Sachin Tendulkar did is going to be a great feeling for me . I hope I can contribute to further success . '
