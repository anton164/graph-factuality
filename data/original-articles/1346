Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood kept faith with Jack Grealish , the 19-year-old academy graduate , after handing him his first Premier League start against Queens Park Rangers a fortnight ago . The young midfielder did not disappoint , playing a part in Christian Benteke 's equaliser and then setting up Fabian Delph 's winner . ` The bigger the stage the better he plays , the more he relishes it , ' said Sherwood who saw Grealish outshine Liverpool 's experienced internationals Steven Gerrard and Jordan Henderson in midfield . ` That 's the sign of a good talent .

Grealish could not wait to share his excitement with Villa fans , tweeting it was the ` Best feeling of my life !! ' and posting pictures from inside the victorious dressing room . Sherwood added : ` Jack 's someone I looked at before I was at the club and when I 've seen him in training , if you give him an instruction he sticks to the plan . He 's got a big future at the club . ' Grealish , who wears children 's shinpads and socks rolled down , won two free-kicks for his team through dribbling with the ball . ` He 's very durable , ' said Sherwood . ` You should see the size of his legs , he 's still a kid . He takes more kicks in training than he does on the pitch so he 's getting a lot of practice fending off kicks -- he probably needs bigger pads !
