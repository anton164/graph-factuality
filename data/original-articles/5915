A bomb technician has used his expertise to create an Easter egg hunt for blind children - using beeping eggs . David Hyche , now a special agent at the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms -LRB- ATF -RRB- , developed the technology nine years ago when his four-month-old daughter turned blind . A transmitter is placed inside plastic eggs that let off a high-pitched beeping sound . Now Hyche has passed on the idea to the Alabama Institute for Deaf and Blind in Birmingham . Festive invention : Blind children in Birmingham , Alabama , have celebrated Easter early by hunting for plastic eggs that let of a beeping sound . They trade the eggs in for candy . The device : Bomb expert David Hyche put a transmitter in a plastic egg so his daughter could join the fun . ` With my daughter , one of her first phrases was , ` I do it myself . ' She wants to do it by herself and most of these kids want to do that too , ' he told WBRC . ` It 's logical for people who are explosives investigators . It 's just a battery , beeper and a switch ... pretty simple . ' Giggling and running around the play area at Brimingham 's regional center , the blind children filled baskets with the beeping eggs , before trading them in for candy . ` We love to give the opportunity for our children with disabilities and their families to come out and have the same opportunity as everybody else does , ' said Tamara Harrison with the Alabama Institute . Hyche -LRB- pictured -RRB- came up with the device when his daughter turned blind nine years ago . The father has shared his idea with the Alabama Institute for Deaf and Blind -LRB- pictured -RRB- this year .
