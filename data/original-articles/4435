Ed Miliband is paying an Argentinian company which has attacked ` vulture ' American bankers to help him become Prime Minister . Left-wing , Buenos Aires-based Tectonica is responsible for the websites of more than 200 Labour parliamentary candidates , including senior figures such as Shadow Foreign Secretary and Election chief Douglas Alexander and Shadow Defence Minister Vernon Coaker , who oversee the Party 's policy on the Falklands . It also designed the websites of Harriet Harman , Andy Burnham and Tristram Hunt . Ed Miliband is paying an Argentinian company which has attacked ` vulture ' American bankers to help him become Prime Minister . Tory MPs last night claimed Labour 's Argentinian link was an ` embarrassment ' for Miliband . Tectonica -- dubbed ` Argie & Argie ' in a jokey reference to Saatchi & Saatchi , the agency that famously helped Margaret Thatcher win the 1979 Election -- is best known for its aggressive campaign against the US in a row over Argentina 's debt crisis , which dates back to the 1982 Falklands War . Its website echoes Argentinian President Cristina Kirchner 's attack on ` senile ' US judge Thomas Griesa , who ruled last year that Argentina must drop its refusal to pay back nearly Â£ 1 billion to US investors . Conservative MP Nadhim Zahawi said : ` If Ed Miliband becomes Prime Minister he would plunge Britain into debt so it is no surprise he is trying to win using a company that believes governments should default on their debts . ` Britain has the best website designers in the world , yet Labour chooses a firm from Argentina to work for them . It is absurd and deeply embarrassing for them . ' Tectonica also designed the websites of Harriet Harman -LRB- left -RRB- , Andy Burnham -LRB- right -RRB- and Tristram Hunt .
