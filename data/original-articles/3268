Arsenal supremo Dick Law has flown to Argentina in an attempt to rubber-stamp the capture of Maxi Romero . The club 's chief negotiator has jetted to South America to finalise a deal for the 16-year-old forward - who has been compared to Lionel Messi . The Gunners are in advanced talks with Velez Sarsfield over a £ 4.5 million swoop for the teenage sensation . Arsenal are close to signing 16-year-old Maxi Romero from Velez Sarsfield for £ 4.5 million . But the deal has been held up by red-tape over the make-up of Romero 's ownership rights - and Law has travelled to Argentina to resolve the issues . Romero 's agents and his club Velez both own stakes in the player , which is causing complications for Arsenal . The Premier League have strict rules regarding third-party ownership and the issue must be settled before he can play for the Gunners . Romero is expected to remain with Velez , on loan , for at least two more seasons before coming to England to begin his career with Arsenal . The youngster is yet to make his senior debut for Velez , but has trained regularly with the first team . The Argentine wonderkid has been dubbed the next Lionel Messi and would stay at Velez on loan .
