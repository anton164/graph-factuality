Whoever snatched a seal or sea lion pup from a Los Angeles beach early Sunday should not confuse the animal 's cuteness with its potentially vicious bite , according to an animal rescue expert . Witnesses to the abduction said four people wrapped the pup in a blanket and left in a car around 3:20 a.m. from Dockweiler State Beach , just west of the city 's international airport , said Los Angeles Police Officer Rosario Herrera . The initial police report said the animal was a small seal . Marine Animal Rescue managed to save another young sea lion shortly after the animal escaped several people said to be harassing it . Witnesses to the abduction said four people wrapped the pup -LRB- not pictured -RRB- in a blanket and left in a car around from Dockweiler State Beach . But a companion pup that escaped and was later found on the beach is a sea lion , according to Peter Wallerstein , the president of the group Marine Animal Rescue . The rescued pup weighs about 25 pounds and is probably 10 months old , said Wallerstein , who stays in a trailer at the beach and was woken by security guards seeking his help . Sea lions of this size are ` really small , really look cute , but they 're dangerous , ' he said . ` These are wild animals . ' They 're also not fit to be kept as pets . Though small pups are cute they can be very dangerous , officials warned . ` The animal needs fluids , needs special treatments , ' he said . ` You ca n't just feed it dog food . It 's not going to work . ' Los Angeles police said an investigation was being conducted by the federal National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . A spokesman for the agency did not return phone messages or an email Sunday .
