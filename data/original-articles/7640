Jimi Manuwa is confident he can return to winning ways , by the method he knows best . The Londoner takes on Jan Blachowicz tonight , more than a year after he suffered his first defeat to Alexander Gustafsson . And Manuwa does n't expect to spend more than 10 minutes in the Octagon . Jimi Manuwa confident he can forget about his first career loss and defeat Polish fighter Jan Blachowicz . ` My training camp in Sweden has gone perfectly , ' he said . ` I did the camp in Stockholm and then the last two weeks in London with my team . I 've got the team here with me now and we 're feeling great for the fight - I 'm looking forward to it . ` I did my camp at All Stars because it 's a great team out there , they 've got great fighters , great management over there . And it lets me get away from my duties in London and I can focus solely on my training . ` Once I get in the Octagon it 's going to be down to business and I 'm going to get the job done . I know the fans will be cheering for me afterwards if they appreciate the good finish I 'm going to get . The Londoner believes his ` aggression and killer instinct ' will help him finish his opponent inside two rounds . ` Look at my record - I always bring a finish . I 've never been a decision fighter . I 've never even been past the second round and so I do n't expect to this time . I know he 's a tough opponent but I expect to get the finish as usual . ` I 've got aggression and killer instinct - more than him . ` He 's a great all-rounder , he 's good everywhere . But I think I 'm an all-round better fighter . My striking is better than his and I would n't say his grappling is better than mine . But that 's the great thing about MMA , you know , you can never predict what 's going to happen . I 've just got to fight my fight . ' Manuwa spoke highly of Blachowicz but all respect will be put to one side once they step into the Octagon .
