Four genuine European heavyweights remain in the Champions League , a quartet steeped in history and silverware . Between Real Madrid , Bayern Munich , Barcelona and Juventus , the big-eared trophy has been lifted 21 times . Any of those clubs would be deserving finalists in the Olympiastadion in Berlin on June 6 . But for tension , intrigue , and the potential for high drama , the match-up that most appeals has to be Real Madrid versus Barcelona . Javier Hernandez 's late winner against Atletico Madrid sent Real Madrid into the Champions League semis . Neymar scored both goals in the second leg as Barcelona beat Paris Saint-Germain 5-1 on aggregate . Transporting El Clasico to east Germany would bring a defining chapter to a myriad narratives , raising Europe 's grandest derby to a level not seen amid years of ebb and flow between the two Spanish behemoths . We have seen plenty of tangles in recent years , notably the Champions League semi-final of 2011 , and some may insist the unseemly battles when the pair faced off 12 times in 19 months a couple of years ago became too much . But never have they duelled in the continent 's largest match . That would crystalise their competition . It would be a fascinating game . Cristiano Ronaldo is looking for his third Champions League trophy and second in a row with Real . Barcelona 's formidable front three of Luis Suarez -LRB- left -RRB- , Neymar -LRB- centre -RRB- and Lionel Messi -LRB- right -RRB- . They have only met twice this season , both times in La Liga . Real Madrid won 3-1 at the Bernabeu before Christmas before Barcelona 's 2-1 win at the Nou Camp last month , so the appetite is not sated this campaign . A deciding third bout at Europe 's main event would draw global crowds not witnessed before . Just think : Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi , the pre-eminent practitioners of this era , head-to-head for the biggest club prize of all . The Preener v the Peruser , Portugal 's athletic might against Argentina 's diminutive delight , the current Ballon d'Or holder against the man who won four consecutively . Barcelona won 3-1 on aggregate when the sides met in the semi-finals of the 2011 Champions League . Gareth Bale scored the winner when Real Madrid beat Barcelona in the 2014 Spanish Cup final . Bale celebrates at the Mestalla after scoring a wonder goal that won the Spanish Cup for Barcelona . Pep Guardiola could come up against his former team Barcelona after guiding Bayern into the last four . Then there 's the undercard fights for supremacy : Gareth Bale , the world 's most expensive signing on paper , vying with Neymar , the game 's costliest player when all told ; Karim Benzema , that deadly Frenchman , versus Luis Suarez , the indefatigable Uruguayan -LRB- both tied on six Champions League goals this season , by the way -RRB- . Both teams have a trident attack to strike fear into their opponents . Whose will triumph on the biggest stage ? It is an intriguing question to pose . Then we have Carlo Ancelotti trying to save his job by going for his fourth European Cup as a manager , against Luis Enrique , who has weathered a storm in his debut season to break the record for number of club wins -LRB- 42 -RRB- in a head coach 's first 50 games . As a player he won La Liga with both Real and Barca but never the Champions League . Messi and Ronaldo have had many duels , and could have another one this season in the Champions League . Pepe heads home during Real Madrid 's 3-1 win over Barcelona in the Clasico at the Bernabeu in October . Suarez scored what proved to be the winner when Barcelona won the La Liga meeting in March . Pep Guardiola facing his old club , the place he delivered dream football and two European Cups , would be tantalising -- be we can have that in the semi-final . He needs to visit the Nou Camp as an opposition manager . That would leave Real vs Juventus in the other last-four match . Two teams with plenty of shared history , not least the 1998 Champions League final when the Italian side 's Zinedine Zidane , now a Real coach , was denied by Predrag Mijatovic 's goal . Yes , Real vs Barca on a June evening in Berlin would capture imaginations and invite the world to watch . Mar 22 , 2015 - La Liga , Barcelona 2-1 Real Madrid .
