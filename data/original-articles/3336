Manchester City are coming up against statistically the deadliest striker in the Premier League when they face Crystal Palace on Easter Monday . Glenn Murray has scored a goal on average every 91 minutes this season - giving him a better minutes-per-goal ratio than anyone else in the top flight . Harry Kane and Diego Costa are locked on 19 goals in the race to finish as this season 's top scorer but rank fourth and fifth respectively , behind Papiss Cisse and Olivier Giroud . Glenn Murray celebrates scoring from the penalty spot against Stoke City last time out . Harry Kane has scored 19 goals for Tottenham in what has been a breakthrough season for him . Chelsea striker Diego Costa has enjoyed a prolific first season in England after signing from Atletico Madrid . Olivier Giroud has had a fine season despite missing a large chunk of it through injury . In-form Arsenal striker Giroud and Newcastle hitman Cisse have had their seasons interrupted by injury and suspension , while Murray was out on loan at Reading until January . Taking into account only players who have played more than 300 minutes of football , Chelsea have four players in the top 10 , including Andre Schurrle , who left for Wolfsburg in January . Costa is expected to miss two weeks of action with a hamstring injury but the minutes-per-goal ratios of Loic Remy and Didier Drogba suggest he wo n't be too sorely missed - they rank eighth and ninth respectively . Intriguingly , ex-Chelsea veteran Frank Lampard has a marginally better ratio than his Manchester City team-mate Sergio Aguero and ranks sixth on the list . But Murray , who has scored four goals for Palace in 364 minutes this season , betters them all . Murray slides in to score for Crystal Palace against Arsenal at Selhurst Park back in February . The experienced frontman celebrates scoring one of two goals he netted against West Ham in February .
