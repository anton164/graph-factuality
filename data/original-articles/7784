Footage shows him gnawing on the side of a drinks container before stopping and prompting his child to follow . The infant then obediently performs the same stunt with a water bottle of her own . The duo then sit together enjoying some bonding time with their simple props , . To date the clip has been watched more than 190,000 times , with many viewers deeming it ` cute ' and ` adorable ' . ` That 's so awesome . I 'm amazed at how she pays attention to you and copies .
