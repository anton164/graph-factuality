Sandro has defended former manager Harry Redknapp , saying he is not at fault for QPR 's predicament . Redknapp branded the situation at QPR a ` soap opera ' and accused people of working against him . But Brazilian midfielder Sandro said that Redknapp , who brought him to the club for Â£ 10million at the start of the season , should not shoulder all the blame , despite leaving the club second from bottom in the table , where they have continued to struggle under stand-in manager Chris Ramsey . ` I do n't think it 's fair to blame him , ' he said . ` I 'm never going to put everything on the coach or the players , it is half and half because everyone has to pull together . If we do n't stay up it 's not Chris 's fault , not just our fault , it 's everyone together . Redknapp said he felt he would have kept Rangers in the Premier League next season if he were still in charge in west London . Some players blame QPR 's slump on Redknapp 's recruitment during the summer transfer window . The QPR midfielder controls the ball during a training session on Friday . They may yet climb out of the drop zone under Ramsey after a 4-1 victory over West Bromwich Albion and a rollercoaster 3-3 draw with Aston Villa left them two points from safety . Sandro said he has seen a change in the mentality of his team-mates and thinks they can overcome league leaders Chelsea on Sunday . ` Everyone , I can see in their face they want to fight , everyone is trying their best to stay up . Everyone now is a leader and makes a difference , ' he said .
