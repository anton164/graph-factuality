To commemorate St George 's Day , the worlds of football and rugby have collided in a crossbar challenge between England stars of both sporting persuasions . Arsenal winger Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Chelsea defender Gary Cahill pitted themselves against Jack Nowell of Exeter Chiefs and Bath 's George Ford at England Rugby 's training centre in Pennyhill Park , Bagshot . Oxlade-Chamberlain , who used to play scrum-half himself , impressed the rugby stars by taking a quick word of advice before ` nailing ' his opening attempt at kicking a conversion - while Cahill seemed more concerned by wearing an oversized shirt .
