Commuters are now able to make phone calls and send texts on the Tube following the launch of new technology enabling phone calls via an internet connection . In what is the first roll out of the technology throughout Europe , the Wi-Fi Calling feature is designed to facilitate calls and texts when users have no mobile phone signal . The technology paves the way for London 's commuters to chat and text inside the capital 's 150 Tube stations where Wi-Fi connections are currently available . London 's Underground platforms could soon be drowned in the sound of commuters chatting on their phones . iPhone users on EE will find their calls and texts automatically connect through the internet when they have no service signal . An EE spokesman said : ` Starting today , iPhone customers on EE can make and receive high quality calls over WiFi and send text messages , using their own phone number with no need to use an app - great for when a mobile signal is unavailable . ' While it is already possible to make phone calls or send messages via Wi-Fi with apps such as WhatsApp and Viber , the new technology works automatically in the user 's phone . After having downloaded the update , EE users on iPhone will see a Wi-Fi Calling section appear in the settings app of their phone , which must be switched to allow to enable the feature . The telecoms firm also confirmed that the new Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 edge will also have the feature on the EE network when it goes on sale this Friday . Rival networks , including O2 and Three , offer apps in order to make calls over Wi-Fi - similar to the Skype service - while Vodafone has said it will be launching a Wi-Fi calling service ` in the summer ' . The telecoms firm is currently in the process of being taken over by BT in a deal worth Â£ 12.5 billion that could see further combinations of technology in order to boost mobile phone reception in the future .
