Ryan Bertrand took to Instagram to upload a snap of himself and his daughter in their matching cars - admittedly , however , one of them probably is n't road legal . The 25-year-old Southampton left back got his little girl a red Ferrari just like his own , before posing with the pair of them outside their home . Bertrand is enjoying an excellent season on the south coast , making 26 Premier League appearances since his summer switch from Chelsea - initially a loan deal that was made permanent in February . Ryan Bertrand poses with his daughter and their matching Ferraris on Instagram . He has been one of their stars of the season as Ronald Koeman 's side currently sit sixth in the Premier League , an impressive feat considering they were widely tipped for relegation at the beginning of the campaign . His form has also seen him force his way back into the England squad , coming on as a second-half substitute during their 1-1 friendly draw in Italy on Tuesday night . Next up for Bertrand and Southampton is a long trip northwards to face Everton in the Premier League on Saturday . Bertrand -LRB- left -RRB- has made 26 Premier League appearances for Southampton so far this season .
