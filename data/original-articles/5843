Sir Oliver Popplewell , the judge who conducted the 1985 Bradford fire public inquiry , says police should look at eight other fires allegedly connected to the then club chairman to ` see if there was anything sinister ' . A new book claims the fire at Bradford 's Valley Parade stadium was one of at least nine blazes at businesses owned by or associated with the club 's then chairman Stafford Heginbotham , who died in 1995 . Popplewell 's inquiry concluded that the cause was an accident probably started by a spectator dropping a cigarette into the rubbish that had accumulated under an old timber stand . The tragic fire at Bradford City 's Valley Parade stadium claimed 56 victims and injured 265 on May 11 , 1985 . Sir Oliver Popplewell -LRB- centre -RRB- , the judge who conducted the 1985 inquiry into the fire , says police should look at eight other fires allegedly connected to the then club chairman to ` see if there was anything sinister ' . He stands by the original ruling saying there was no evidence of arson . But he said : ` I do n't think it 's going to affect what we decided but I think it is important from a public point of view that the police look at the other fires and see if there was anything sinister . It is a remarkable number . ` I think it 's important to satisfy people 's minds that the other fires are unconnected . ' The tragic fire at Valley Parade killed 56 people and injured at least 265 after it broke out during a Football League Third division match against Lincoln City on Saturday , May 11 , 1985 . A memorial at Valley Parade pays tribute those who died in the devastating blaze almost 30 years ago .
