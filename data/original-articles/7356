A German man who had his penis enlarged with silicone injections claims it now weighs half a stone . Micha Stunz , has a 9 inch-long , 3.5 inch penis that now weighs between 7.5 -- 9.5 lbs , between 3 and 4.3 kg , he says . ` I ca n't say exactly how much it weighs , I just know that my kitchen scale , which shows up to 6.6 lb , has n't been enough for a while , ' he told Vice.com . Mr Stunz , 45 , who lives in Berlin , said he had his penis permanently enlarged in this way , not because it makes him feel more beautiful , but because it makes him feel ` better ' . Micha Stunz , 45 , has permanently enlarged his penis with silicone injections . It is now 9 inches long and weighs up to 9.5 lbs -LRB- 4.3 kg -RRB- , he claims . He uses his satchel to cover up his groin area when he is in public . ` I 'm actually a pretty shy person , ' he said . Curiously , the silicone implants provide no physical pleasure and actually make sex much more difficult for him - although it is not impossible . He can not get a normal erection -- and any increase in size is not visible due to all the silicone . But although his giant penis restricts his sex life , he says it makes him more creative in the bedroom . He told Vice : ` After you reach a certain size , you ca n't do certain things any more . ` At least not with everyone and not without some foreplay . But there are other things you can do with it . You just have to free yourself from established roles and ideas about sex and be ready to play . ' Mr Stunz 's interest in penis modification 20 years ago , when he was given a pump as a present . ` I was way too curious not to try it out . First , I tried it secretly for myself , ' he said . ` And I found that when I went out pumped up , it was a good feeling , it felt great . ' Mr Stunz 's interest in penis modifications were piqued when he was given a penis pump at 20-years-old and found it felt ` great ' . He moved on to saline injections before opting for the more permanent silicone ones . ` I had the feeling that I was n't trapped in the body I was born with , but that I had the possibility to shape it myself to change it . ' He then began enlarging himself with saline injections . ` The feeling was great , ' he said , ` but I did n't like getting the injections - there 's always a risk of infection . ` And also the people around me started to wonder why my groin area would change in size . ` That 's why I started looking for something more permanent . ' It took him several years to find out about silicone injections , which were only available in London when he first began researching them . However , rather than seeking professional medical help , he met a medical student who agreed to perform the first injections . To date , Mr Stunz has had four procedures which involved injecting silicone into his penis and scrotum . However , Dr Aref el Seweife , a urologist in Berlin who carries out penis enlargements , warns that an injecting silicon into the penis can lead to an infection that will leave it ` mutilated ' . ` In worst cases , it can lead to an enlarged artery in the scrotum and the testicles die , ' he told Vice journalists , urging people who opt for the procedure to have it done by a medical professional . In fact , a 2012 study in the Urology Annals , said : ` We conclude that penile enhancement procedures with liquid silicone by non-medical personnel could result in devastating consequences . ' Mr Stunz said he uses a satchel to cover his modesty and refrains from telling certain people - such as his boss or his extended relations - about his enlarged penis . Mr Stunz accepts this advice , and agrees that others thinking of having their penis enlarged with silicone should make sure they are fully informed . While his situation might seem extreme , he claims he leads a ` normal life ' . He said : ` I go to work , buy groceries , go to bars , clubs , and to the movies . I usually try to make sure it is n't too obvious . But I guess it is n't easy buying a new pair of pants . ' Penis size has been a source of anxiety for men throughout history - and this concern has been found to transcend ethnicity and cultural barriers . Sadhus , holy men of India and male of Cholomec tribe in Peru used weights to increase their penile lengths . Males of the Dayak tribe in Borneo resorted to self mutilation by forming holes on their penises and then sticking decorative items through them for their partner 's pleasure . Brazilians of the Topinama tribe allowed poisonous snakes to bite their penises in order to enlarge them . Men in some areas of Indonesia , the Philippines , Thailand , and Malaysia have a long history of inserting or implanting various objects in their penises . Several documented papers have described how ` the bigger the better ' mantra has been the motto for more than a century - and being too small is still regarded as very humiliating in many cultures . These stigmas of apparently small penises , as well as the increasing influence of the media on sexual issues , have increased the demand for penile enhancements , figures show . However the majority of men who request penile enhancement surgery usually have a normally sized and normally functioning penis , doctors say . These patients interpret normal appearances as abnormal , and as such are distressed and depressed . Source : Urology Annals . He also prefers to urinate sitting down in a cubicle as he attracts odd looks when using urinals . While sometimes he says he is pleased to get so much attention , at other points he hides his modesty . He uses a satchel bag to ` hide his bulge ' and refrains from telling some people in his life about his physical appearance . ` There are definitely situations when I say `` the other person does n't need to know right now '' . When it 's the boss or all the extended relations , then I 'll tell a white lie . ` I 'm actually a pretty shy person , ' he explains , while leather-clad at a bondage festival . Indeed , one of his favourite events of the year is The Folsom Europe Festival -- a bondage , fetish and latex affair in Berlin . When he attends the carnival , he wears a specially-made pair of latex pants to show off his huge penis . Speaking of why he loves the event , he said : ` You can offer up who you are and show yourself the way you want without having to think about what other people will think of you . ' He sometimes worries that potential partners are only interested in him for his manhood . He said : ` You get reduced to the bulge obviously . There 's always that danger in the relationship . ` But if you take the time to get to know the other person , you find out whether he really loves you or just a part of you . ' Ultimately , Mr Stunz believed the interest in his penis modification belies deep-rooted sexism . ` If some woman gets breast enlargements , nobody says anything about it , ' he said . ` If a man does something very similar to his body , it 's worth making a documentary about it because it 's so extraordinary . ` I hope that changes soon because the difference really is n't that big . ' Mr Stunz said the silicone implants make sex much more difficult , although it is not impossible .
