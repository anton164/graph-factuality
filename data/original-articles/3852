After nine hours reading the verdict at South Jakarta District Court , presiding judge Nur Aslam said that Bantleman was guilty of abusing the children . ` The defendant did not admit his crime or express regret for his deeds , nor did he apologise for what he did , which psychologically damaged underage children , ' she said .

The scandal , which erupted in April last year with accusations of abuse levelled at cleaning staff , has sparked deep unease among Jakarta 's expatriate community and foreign governments alike . U.S. ambassador to Indonesia , Robert Blake , said there were serious questions about ` the investigative process and lack of credible evidence against the teachers ' . ` We are deeply disappointed with this outcome ... the broad international community is following this case closely . ` The outcome of the legal process and what it reveals about the rule of law in Indonesia will have a significant impact on Indonesia 's reputation abroad .

International disapproval : The British Embassy in Jakarta said in a statement there were ` concerns about irregularities in this case ' Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Rob Nicholson said that Canada had ` called for a fair and transparent trial throughout the judicial process ' . Accusations of assault at the school - formerly known as the Jakarta International School - initially sparked horror among the expatriate community . But the focus soon shifted to what supporters say was an unfair attempt to target Bantleman and Tjiong by Indonesia 's notoriously corrupt police and judicial system . Supporters have accused police of a botched investigation , and point to unfair trials , which the judge closed to the public as they involved children . The court was open to the public for the reading of the verdicts . The prosecution insists that the testimony of the alleged victims , all boys , is the truth and that their claims are backed up by evidence from medical examinations . However , the defence argues the medical exams were flawed . The men have said the decision to prosecute them revolved around a separate lawsuit filed by the family of one of the alleged victims , which demands $ 125million in compensation from the school .
