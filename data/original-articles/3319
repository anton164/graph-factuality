Louis van Gaal has revealed that he has spoken to Marouane Fellaini about keeping his cool when the Manchester United midfielder returns to Goodison Park on Sunday for the first time since his Â£ 27million move from Everton . Fellaini , who followed manager David Moyes to Old Trafford in the summer of 2013 , is set for a more hostile reception than Juan Mata received at his old club Chelsea last weekend . The Belgium international became a symbol for the failure of the Moyes era but has turned his career around under Van Gaal and goes back to Merseyside as an established first-team player at United .

Louis van Gaal has spoken to Fellaini about keeping his cool on his first return to Goodison Park . Asked about suggestions at Everton that Fellaini has a short fuse , Van Gaal said : ` I have spoken with Fellaini because I know this . Fellaini is always dry in his answers . He said `` it 's a game '' . Yes , but it 's a special game for you . I hope the fans shall receive him like the Chelsea fans received Juan Mata because I like that very much . I hope it 's like that . ` I am always communicating with my players about philosophy , performance , attitude , behaviour , and maybe one or two aspects more . ` That is what I 'm doing , not more than that . When players believe in you they want to convince me because every player playing for Manchester United has qualities . ` Also Marouane Fellaini has qualities and we want to let his qualities dominate in the team and that is what we are trying to do . I believe that we are doing that . That 's why his performances are better just now . ' United have confirmed that Rafael has been ruled out of the remaining five games of the season with a rib injury , and Van Gaal expects to be without Michael Carrick , Phil Jones , Marcos Rojo and Daley Blind for the trip to Goodison after all four players missed the defeat at Chelsea .

Van Gaal insists that fellow Dutchman Van Persie -LRB- centre -RRB- must show his qualities in United 's second team . ` All the players are still injured , ' he said . ` Only Blind maybe , it 's a question mark , can reach the game against Everton . Jones , Carrick and Rojo can not play against Everton . ' Robin van Persie is unlikely to regain his starting place despite playing for the Under 21s against Leicester earlier in the week . The Holland striker was an unused substitute at Stamford Bridge , and Van Gaal said : ` He has to train very hard and play in the second team and show his qualities again . Then I have to compare him with the positions he can play with the players in that position . It 's always the same .

We set this goal because it was very difficult to reach the top four . We have discussed our goal with the board and the owners and they have set this goal . ` I am the manager and I have to achieve , but they have set this goal for me to achieve . I am always in a club to win the championship not the third or fourth position . If we achieve our goal my board and the owners will be very happy .
