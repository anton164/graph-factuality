Zinedine Zidane has sparked a potential transfer battle with Chelsea after claiming that Eden Hazard excites him more than Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi . The Real Madrid reserve boss was unashamed in his praise for Hazard , who could be named PFA Player of the Year this weekend . Zidane 's comments are sure to agitate those at Stamford Bridge , who only tied the Belgian down to a new five-year deal in February . Eden Hazard fires past David de Gea to score the winning goal against Manchester United last Saturday . Zinedine Zidane , picture playing in a United Nations charity match , has revealed his admiration for Hazard . ` Obviously , there is Lionel Messi and Ronaldo , both of whom are spectacular , but I like Eden Hazard more , ' Zidane , who is tipped as a future manager at the Bernabeu , told fifa.com . ` I like everything he does on the field . I like his behaviour , his decisiveness and love to see his progress every year . ' Hazard 's form for Jose Mourinho 's side has been a major factor in Chelsea 's impending Premier League title victory this season . That and his new deal will mean the Blues are sure to firmly resist any offers if they were to materialise . Zidane added : ` There is still scope for further progress , and if Chelsea are to win the league this season , Eden will have had a lot to do with it . ' Hazard slides on his knees after scoring against United to edge Chelsea one step closer to the title .
