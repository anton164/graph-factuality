A Russian woman indundated with vicious and homophobic messages for running a support group for LGBT teenagers , has publicly shamed her trolls by posting their identities online . Elena Klimova , 26 , who runs Children 404 - an online support group for young people about coming out and dealing with discrimination - regularly receives obscene hate-filled rants from strangers telling her she 's ` disgusting ' and should kill herself . The activist fought back by publishing the messages on VKontakte , the Russian equivalent of Facebook , under the title : ` Beautiful People And The Things They Say To Me ' . Elena Klimova managed to track down the social media accounts of many of her trolls , and has posted their vile messages along with candid photos of each sender -LRB- pictured -RRB- to a Russian website called VKontakte . Comments include one from a man who told her : You f ****** animal , delete your f ****** LGBT group . ' A woman named Yulia sent Elena a particularly vitriolic message . ` Hello , Lena . My f * g brother ... is one of your friends online , so I have a request for you , teach him not to show his f ***** tendencies when he comes to family gatherings . ` He will never be accepted by anyone in our family as a f ** , so he can sit and shut up .
