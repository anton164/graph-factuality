' ` Of the respondents we polled , many said that often a quick and concise conference call was more effective than a lengthy meeting which often resulted in expensive travel expenses . ' The poll showed one in five employees has nodded off in a meeting at some point in their career , with the typical person dozing off for two minutes . For a quarter of those , their colleagues saw the funny side although 18 per cent experienced the wrath of their boss after catching forty winks .
