Two college students have been charged in connection to an unconscious girl who was allegedly gang raped on a Florida beach during Spring Break in broad daylight , authorities said . Troy University students Delonte ' Martistee , 22 , of Georgia and Ryan Austin Calhoun , 23 , of Alabama were charged on Friday with sexual battery by multiple perpetrators relating to the incident that occurred between March 10-12 , according to Bay County Sheriff 's Office . According to WFSA , it has been confirmed by university officials that both men were suspended , and Martistee , a promising track star , has been removed from the team . The alleged victim told deputies she thought she had been drugged before the incident and that she was afraid to report it because she could not remember many details , Panama City News Herald reported .

Delonte ' Martistee , 22 , -LRB- left -RRB- and Ryan Austin Calhoun , 23 , -LRB- right -RRB- have been charged in connection with the alleged rape after police in Troy , Alabama , found the clip on a cell phone during another investigation . Martistee of Bainbridge , Georgia is a promising track star at Troy University according to officials , but he has since been removed from the team . Calhoun of Mobile , Alabama was suspended from Troy University along with Martistee , university officials confirmed . ` She knows something happened , but she does n't know what happened , ' Bay County Sheriff Frank McKeithen said . Authorities are still searching for two additional suspects in the case . Friday 's charges stem from a video police found where hundreds of people are seen watching the incident without attempting to intervene during the alleged attack on Panama City Beach , authorities claim . The footage was uncovered on a cell phone during an unconnected investigation into a shooting in Troy , Alabama . Alerting the Bay County Sheriff 's Office , the two departments worked together to identify two suspects and the alleged victim . McKeithen branded the video the ` most disgusting , sickening thing ' and likened the scene to ` wild animals preying on a carcass laying in the woods ' . Following the incident that occurred between March 10-12 , the men were arrested and charged on Friday and were taken to the Bay County Jail as they await their first appearance . In the video , McKeithen said one man is heard in the clip saying , ` she is n't going to know , ' before putting his hand inside her bikini bottoms . The incapacitated young woman is surrounded by several men while seated on a beach chair during the video filmed behind Spinnaker Beach Club . McKeithen told a press conference : ` This is happening in broad daylight with hundreds of people seeing and hearing what is happening and they are more concerned about spilling their beer than somebody being raped . ` This is such a traumatizing event for this girl . No one should have to fear this would happen in Panama City Beach , but it does . ' Authorities said hundreds of people walked past but did not stop the attack near Spinnaker Beach Club on Panama City Beach , Florida , in broad daylight during a Spring Break party last month . The sheriff 's office said it has encountered incidents like this before through leads found on social media . In one video , police said a crowd pours beer on a girl who appears to be incapacitated while a male performs a sexual act on her . And recently , officers took inventory of the guns and drugs recovered during Spring Break this year which included marijuana , MDMA , cocaine , heroin as well as 49 handguns - which increased from nine last year . This most recent alleged sexual attack and the arrests made on Friday have served as a tipping point for the Bay County Sheriff 's Office . McKeithen touted laws during Spring Break such as banning drinking on the beach and parking lots as well as clubs not being able to allow non-military people under 21 to enter . He said he will fight to have even more strict Spring Break regulations in the coming year . ` This draws the line in the sand for us , ' he said . ` It is not safe for our children on the beach ... If you condone this behavior , you should be in jail , as far as I 'm concerned . ' The investigation related to the incident is ongoing .
