A former Weber County court clerk has won a sexual harassment lawsuit against a former judge who wrote a love poem to her . A federal jury in Salt Lake City on Thursday awarded more than $ 270,000 to Marcia Eisenhour after finding that former Justice Court Judge Craig Storey violated her right to equal protection . The jury found Storey liable for some $ 240,000 of the damages and the county liable for the rest . Storey wrote in 2007 , ` I 'd love to harvest your sweet grapes , ' and called Eisenhour the ` most gorgeous thing alive . ' Storey was a judge for Weber County Justice Court from 1984 until 2010 , when a new Ogden Justice Court -LRB- pictured -RRB- opened and took over the county 's caseload . Utah 's Standard Examiner reported that the ` semi-erotic love poem ' was 11 pages long . Storey testified that he never intended for her to find or read the poem . Crucial to the case was a meeting Ms Eisenhour had with the Court Judge in July 2008 after she had seen the love note . Storey was said to have asked whether she was in a relationship and where she was going on holiday . For Ms Eisenhour this proved the ` last straw ' as far as his possessiveness of her was concerned . Storey claimed his worries related to Ms Eisenhour 's weight-loss , recent job performance and absences . He said he was going to have to change her work hours because of complaints from other court staff . Eisenhour said her absences were her attempts to avoid the judge . Storey was a judge for Weber County Justice Court from 1984 until 2010 , when a new Ogden Justice Court opened and took over the county 's caseload . Eisenhour was a court employee for over 25 years . Eisenhour 's attorney April Hollingsworth said she suspected the case was not over , that Storey 's and the county 's lawyers have indicated they would be filing motions for a new trial .
