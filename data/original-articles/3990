Graeme Dott fears exhaustion will kill off his hopes of winning snooker 's Betfred World Championship . The 37-year-old , a qualifier this year , survived a series of twitches close to the winning line before clinching a 10-8 first-round victory over Ricky Walden at the Crucible in Sheffield on Sunday . He bungled a yellow but was reprieved when Walden blazed the green off the table . And although Walden looked for snookers , his tournament was over once Dott dropped in the blue . Dott , who is through to the last 16 , remains aggrieved by having to play three best-of-19-frame matches just to get to the main draw . The previous format meant a player of his standing had just one to negotiate . Graeme Dott celebrates after booking his place in the second round of the World Championships . The 37-year-old survived a series of twitches close to the winning line before clinching a 10-8 first-round win . ` If you get qualifiers that are just happy to be here at the Crucible and get their pictures taken the three matches help , ' Dott said who won the title in 2006 . ` But if you 've got aspirations to win it 's going to hinder you later on . ` You can see fatigue kicking in if you got to the semis because of those three extra matches . ` I 've been to three finals and know how tiring it is . ' But he added : ` I was n't here last year which was a horrible feeling . It 's nice to know you can still do it at the Crucible . ' Meanwhile , John Higgins impressed with a 10-5 victory over Robert Milkins , and looked to be approaching the form that last saw him take the last of his four world titles in 2011 . Milkins said of his conqueror : ` It 's going to take a good man to beat him on that form . I did well to get five frames .
