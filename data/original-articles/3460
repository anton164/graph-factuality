Nine months after she suffered horrific injuries in a brutal attack , former porn star Christy Mack still has to wear a wig and glasses to look herself . With 18 broken bones , a broken nose , a ruptured kidney , a ruptured liver , missing teeth , and a fractured rib , Mack was unrecognisable as she fled her Las Vegas home on August 8 , 2014 . It was the climax , she claims , of an abusive on-off relationship with MMA fighter Jonathan Paul Koppenhaver , known professionally as War Machine . She is still undergoing reparative dental work - while fighting to see Koppenhaver convicted of attempted murder . The journey , she told ESPN , has been monumental . Scroll down for video . Nine months ago , Christy Mack was in hospital fighting for her life . Now she is on the road to recovery .

So when I 'd look in the mirror , it 's not me - that person was n't me . It 's so hard to go every day without being you anymore . ' Mack , 23 , claims Koppenhaver , 33 , became abusive four months into their one-year relationship , which started fast . When they met on a photo shoot set , she had pneumonia and he offered to look after her , bringing pizza to her hotel , she told ESPN . ` It was an amazing connection . I feel in love really quick , ' she said . Mack posted this message on Twitter soon after the attack to show how she had been hurt .

Around six months later , a male friend Corey Thomas was sleeping in her bed when she says Koppenhaver , who had a spare key , burst in .
