Real Madrid 's Spanish star Isco admitted he is unhappy with life at the Bernabeu , after losing his place in the starting line-up in recent weeks . Despite being one of Real 's best players this season , in the absence of injured Colombian playmaker James Rodriguez , Isco fell straight back out of the team when Rodriguez returned to fitness . And when he was asked about whether he understood the decision , Isco was forthright in his criticism of Carlo Ancelotti 's choice . Isco -LRB- left -RRB- returned to the Real Madrid starting XI for the Champions League semi-final , but only due to injuries . Isco has been in phenomenal form this season , but has seen his place come under threat recently . ` I am more than hurt , so I 'm not very happy , ' he told Canal + after Real reached the Champions League semi-finals . ` I thought he was doing a good job . ' Isco returned to the starting XI for the second leg of the Madrid derby in the quarter-finals , as injuries to Gareth Bale and Luka Modric forced Ancelotti into a change of system . But it is not clear whether he can tie down a place long term in a team that features Cristiano Ronaldo , Bale , Rodriguez , Modric and Toni Kroos . The Spaniard admitted that he was unhappy after James Rodriguez 's return saw him drop to the bench .
