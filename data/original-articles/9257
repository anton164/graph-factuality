The image was first shared on Reddit under the headline ` Dad security ' at the weekend . A dad created this t-shirt to keep the boys away from his daughter - and she does n't look happy about it .

' By Wednesday , the image on his page had been liked by 370,000 Facebook users and had been shared more than 45,000 times . While some commenters both applauded the move - and even asked whether the girl was in need of a step-mother - others ridiculed it . ` Dads thought process : How can I tell more people I work out , and not look like a tool ?
