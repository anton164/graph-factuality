Michael Vaughan , Alec Stewart and Andrew Strauss are three former captains bidding to lead England 's reform after Paul Downton was sacked as managing director . All three achieved a great deal while playing for England and are well-respected figures within the game . Sportsmail takes a closer look at the trio battling to become the most powerful man in English cricket . Alec Stewart -LRB- Age 52 -RRB- . CURRENT JOB : Director of cricket at Surrey . SHOW US YOUR MEDALS : Played 133 Tests , more than any England cricketer . PLAYERS HE LIKES : Has established a rapport at Surrey with the out-of-favour Kevin Pietersen -- says English cricket needs to be bold . REASON IT MIGHT HAPPEN : Stewart has added his name to the ring of potential candidates , and knows the job of director of cricket inside out .
