Ronald Koeman has promised not leave Southampton this summer , even if Barcelona were to come calling . Eyebrows were raised by some last summer when the Dutch great took the reins of what many expected to be a sinking ship . Koeman , though , has been revelation in his first season in English football , not only steering Saints to calmer waters but new heights . Southampton manager Ronald Koeman has promised not leave Southampton this summer for a bigger club . Barcelona and the likes of Neymar -LRB- top -RRB- are not of interest to Koeman after his successful season . Even managing Cristiano Ronaldo at Real Madrid does not appeal over England 's south coast for Koeman . Only a point is needed to break the record Premier League points tally set last season under Mauricio Pochettino , who returns to St Mary 's for the first time since leaving last summer when Tottenham arrive on Saturday . The former Saints boss is unlikely to receive a particularly warm welcome at St Mary 's after jumping ship - something Koeman has told fans he would not do this summer . Asked this week at a Barclays q & Barclays event what he would do if Real Madrid came calling this summer , the Dutchman said : ` Oh , Real Madrid ? No , no , no . Not with Real Madrid . Never , never . You can trust me . ' When asked what he would say if former club Barcelona came calling , Koeman said laughing : ` Oh , you make it more difficult . No , I stay . Koeman 's Southampton only need a point to break their record Premier League points tally set last season . Saints were tipped by many for relegation in pre-season but they have a chance of European qualification . ` I am still young for the manager role . It is good to stay and to be the manager of Southampton . ` It is a very nice experience to be part of the Premier League . It is the best competition in the world and it is nice to be part of that .
