The Rangers board have held their first meeting with Mike Ashley since assuming control at Ibrox . Interim chairman Paul Murray and director John Gilligan held talks with Ashley and other members of the Sports Direct hierarchy on Wednesday . While no details of the discussions have been disclosed , supporters will hope it may represent an initial step towards finding an amicable way forward with the billionaire owner of Newcastle United . Controversial Sports Direct and Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley has secured an 8.92 stake in Rangers . Murray , Gilligan and Dave King ousted Ashley allies Derek Llambias and Barry Leach from the Ibrox board at an EGM on March 6 and have since spent time studying all the club 's existing contracts and commercial arrangements . Sports Direct loaned the previous Rangers regime £ 5million in January , receiving security over various assets -- including club trademarks -- in return . They also have the right , yet to be exercised , to appoint two directors to the board . That deal also saw Ashley 's firm take a 75 per cent grip of the Rangers Retail subsidiary , increasing their stranglehold over merchandising income . The new Ibrox board last month revealed they would not be drawing down the second £ 5 million available from Sports Direct , instead accepting a £ 1.5 million loan from the Three Bears consortium for short-term financing while they formulate a longer-term funding plan . Ashley owns an 8.92 per cent stake in Rangers , with the SFA rejecting an approach to raise his current 10 per cent limit late last year . -LRB- Left to right : -rrb- Richard Gough , Paul Murray , Dave King and John Gilligan discuss the future of Rangers .
