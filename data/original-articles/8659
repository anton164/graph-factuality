She said : ` I think I 'm a better striker than Paige , a better grappler than Paige , I have a better submission skill set than Paige , I 'm stronger than Paige and more athletic than Paige so I believe I 'll be able to take the fight wherever I want to . ` I 'm glad Paige has a lot of hype around her because I feel when I beat her it will make the victory that much sweeter and feel that much more rewarding and it will make people respect me more . ' At only 21 and with just five professional fights to her name , VanZant has enjoyed a spectacular rise since her first bout in 2012 . After three wins and a decision defeat , she was signed by the UFC for the newly-formed 115 lb division and initially selected to appear on the Ultimate Fighter .

I hope to win every fight the UFC offers me and see where this crazy journey can take me ' . VanZant has a realistic chance of becoming the UFC 's youngest-ever champion . That record belongs to light-heavyweight Jon Jones who won the title in 2011 aged 23 . ` Obviously , that would be huge , and that would be awesome ; I try not to think about it and try not to focus on setting records , ' she told MMAjunkie . ` I strictly want to beat every opponent I face whether it 's for a title or for a small show . The only thing for me is winning my fights and being the best athlete I can be . ' Victory for VanZant will take her closer to a title shot as she bids to become the youngest-ever champion .
