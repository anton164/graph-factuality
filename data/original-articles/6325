The familiar brown signs are set up to show tourists where to find an area 's finest attractions . So visitors to Dornoch 's golf course or the Sutherland town 's historic cathedral were surprised instead to be pointed in the direction of some toilets , the local GP ... and an abattoir . And even if bewildered tourists did suddenly fancy a trip to the slaughterhouse , they would discover it is in the process of being demolished . On a visit to the Scottish town of Dornoch , tourists are pointed towards the local slaughterhouse . Visitors to Dornoch , pictured , have to move quickly if they wish to visit the abattoir - as its being demolished . The bizarre sign caused an online stir after it was posted on Twitter and retweeted by Scots crime writer Ian Rankin . The photo was originally put online by Jon Palmer from The Cheese House , Cromarty , who tweeted : ` Market day tomorrow in the town that has all bases covered when it comes to tourist attractions . ' The tweet then quickly drew a series of facetious online comments . Stephen Foster asked : ` Sweeney Todd lives anywhere nearby ? ' Malcolm Ramsay said : ` A trip to Dornoch ? It 's kill or cure ... ' Gavin Sutherland of Gavin 's Traditional Butchers , based in the nearby retail park in Dornoch , said yesterday of the abattoir : ` It has been knocked to the ground . They are demolishing it as we speak . It 's been derelict for four or five years . ' Brown signs normally only point to attractions or sites of historic significance . A Highland Council spokesman said : ` We are looking into the current status and accuracy of the sign in question . '
