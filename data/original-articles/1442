Stoke are set to complete their third signing from Barcelona in less than two years , according to the agent of Moroccan winger Moha El Ouriachi . Potters manager Mark Hughes , the former Barcelona striker , has already snapped up Bojan Krkic and Marc Muniesa from the Nou Camp and teenager El Ouriachi now looks to be on his way to the Britannia Stadium this summer . The 19-year-old Barcelona B player is apparently keen to seek first-team action rather than extend his contract with the Spanish giants . Barcelona B winger Moha El Ouriachi is set to sign for Stoke City , according to the player 's agent . El Ouriachi is turning down a new deal with the Catalans to take up an irresistible offer by Stoke . ` We thank Barca for the deal they offered the player and the efforts they have gone to try to renew his contract , ' El Ouriachi 's agent , Raul Verdu , told Catalan newspaper Sport . ` But another proposal was really interesting on both a professional and economic level . ` Moha has the option of joining the first team squad at Stoke and that was irresistible . ' Stoke have already signed Bojan Krkic and Marc Muniesa from Barcelona in the last two years . El Ouriachi has represented Spain at youth level and Sport reported that Stoke have agreed to pay the necessary training compensation to bring the pacey left winger to the Barclays Premier League . Both Bojan and Muniesa have settled well at Stoke , although the former - who had scored five goals in 18 appearances following his shock move last summer - was ruled out for the rest of the season after damaging cruciate knee ligaments in an FA Cup tie at Rochdale in January . Defender Muniesa has made nearly 40 appearances since joining from Barcelona in the summer of 2013 but has not featured since tearing a hamstring in the FA Cup defeat at Blackburn in February .
