Tom Croft has received a huge lift at the start of his latest long journey back to fitness by securing a new deal at Leicester . The club future of the England and Lions flanker appeared to be in doubt last month when his cruel injury jinx struck again . Croft suffered a dislocated shoulder in the Tigers ' victory over Newcastle and , after surgery , he was left facing six months of rehabilitation . In 2012 , the 29-year-old suffered a broken neck and he missed most of last season with a knee injury while this latest setback has almost certainly ruled him out of the World Cup . Tom Croft has signed a new deal with Leicester which keeps him with the Tigers despite his injury troubles . Despite Croft 's lack of action in recent years director of rugby Richard Cockerill said : ` I have agreed a contract with him . Tom has had some poor luck injury-wise . We all know when Tom 's fit he is world-class . ` He is still relatively young . He has been very loyal to the club over a long period and we have supported him hugely . It 's the right thing to do . I think he will come back and we will be talking about Tom Croft playing how Tom Croft can play . '
