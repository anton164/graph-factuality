It appears that David Luiz has taken the phrase ` twiddling my hair ' literally judging by the injured Paris Saint-Germain star 's latest Instagram post . The PSG defender is out for at least four weeks after scans revealed that the 27-year-old suffered a torn hamstring in Sunday 's 3-2 win at Ligue 1 title rivals Marseille . And it seems that boredom has already kicked into the usually jovial Brazilian as he sported a new hairdo on Wednesday . David Luiz posted an Instagram picture sporting a new hairdo in the style of a man bun on Wednesday . Luiz -LRB- centre -RRB- has time on his hands at present after tearing a hamstring at Marseille on Sunday night . The Paris Saint-Germain defender immediately signalled to the bench that he would need to be replaced . Accompanied with the caption : ` Parisien ! ' Luiz has his usually flowing brown locks styled into a man bun . The centre back 's new look seems to be a source of amusement for his PSG team-mate Lucas Moura who later shared a picture with Luiz among his Instagram followers . ` I 'll let you choose the nickname , ' the midfielder wrote as he referred to Luiz 's barnet later that afternoon . And while Luiz 's hair may be a laughing matter to his team-mates , his injury will not be for manager Laurent Blanc as they seek Ligue 1 and Champions League glory this season . The former Chelsea defender will miss both legs of their quarter-final tie against Barcelona in Europe , while potentially missing eight league matches as they look to defend their crown . The 27-year-old -LRB- left -RRB- will be out for at least four weeks after scans revealed the severity of the injury .
