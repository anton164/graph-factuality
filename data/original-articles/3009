Suddenly music begins playing and the woman starts pumping her legs up and down as the two volunteers struggle to hold on . The woman shows amazing strength by remaining in the position for some time before she begins twirling the plank of wood -- removing a leg in between rotations . The incredible showing of strength was videoed at a birthday party in China 's Sichuan Province . Four people attach themselves to the wood and the plank is lifted onto the woman 's feet by the assistants .
