Nabil Fekir 's father insists Arsenal would be the ideal destination for his son , rather than a move to Manchester City . The young Lyon star has been attracting interest from Premier League clubs but the frontman 's father Mohamed does not want him to sit on the bench at Man City and claims he would progress with Arsenal under Arsene Wenger . Fekir recently split with his agents after his family were reportedly disappointed with their insistence on pursuing a deal with City . Nabil Fekir 's father believes a move to Arsenal would benefit the Lyon star , rather than a switch to Man City . Fekir -LRB- centre -RRB- is congratulated by his team-mates after scoring the opener in Lyon 's 3-1 win over Guingamp . According to Foot Mercato , Fekir 's father said : ` They pushed for him to sign for City . But I told them if he goes to City and finds himself on the bench , it does n't interest me , and the kid is not interested either . ` He loves to play , he does not like to be replaced . And they pushed to sign him for City , that 's why he preferred to stop with them . ' Speaking to La Perisien , the 21-year-old 's father also said : ` Nabil would like to finish 1st or 2nd and play Champions League football with Lyon . If he leaves , it 'll be for Arsenal . It 's the only club that can enable him to progress , with Arsene Wenger . He will not go to Manchester City to sit on the bench . ' Fekir , who made a substitute appearance for France against Brazil last month , scored Lyon 's opener in the 3-1 win over Guingamp on Saturday . Fekir weaves his way between Guingamp duo Younousse Sankhare and Lionel Mathis during Saturday 's win .
