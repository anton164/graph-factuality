It 's been a good couple of weeks for Ander Herrera and Juan Mata , so you 'd forgive the Spanish duo for taking some time off to enjoy the Manchester sunshine on Wednesday . The pair have been in scintillating form in recent games with both bagging braces in Manchester United 's last two victories . Mata was the two-goal hero during his side 's 2-1 win against Liverpool in May with his sensational volley on the hour mark proving the highlight of the Anfield triumph . Ander Herrera races away to celebrate after he scored his second goal against Aston Villa on Saturday . Herrera 's late goal capped off a 3-1 win for Louis van Gaal 's side ; it was their fifth Premier League win in a row . Ander Herrera posted his picture on his Instagram with his Manchester United team-mate Juan Mata -LRB- left -RRB- . Herrera followed up his compatriot 's achievement with a brace of his own as United stormed to a 3-1 victory against Aston Villa on Saturday . That win lifted United above bitter rivals Manchester City to third in the Premier League table with the two sides set to clash in the Manchester derby at Old Trafford on Sunday . No doubt Louis van Gaal will be hoping the pair continue their hot-streak against Manuel Pellegrini 's men as they look to cement their place in next season 's Champions League . Juan Mata completed his brace against Liverpool with a stunning volley on the hour mark at Anfield .
