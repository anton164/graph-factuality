The unemployment rate for college graduates grew by 1.5 per cent in 2014 , despite President Obama 's promise to reverse the trend . The Labor Department reported on Thursday that the number of jobless Americans in their 20s armed with a four-year or advanced degree rose to 12.4 per cent last year from 10.9 per cent in 2013 . Philip Gardner , director of Michigan State University 's Collegiate Employment Research Institute , told the Associated Press that engineering and business majors have the most chance on landing a job in today 's competitive market .

And Holly Proffitt , employer relations coordinator in the career services office at Arkansas State University , confirmed Gardner 's observations . ` We ca n't graduate enough engineers , ' she said . Despite the recent news , in a survey of employers last fall by Michigan State University , the employment center found that hiring of graduates will rise 16per cent this year . Indeed , the consulting and accounting firm EY is aggressively recruiting on college campuses this spring . It plans to hire 9,000 graduates from U.S. universities this year , up from 7,500 in 2014 . The overall unemployment rate has fallen to 5.5 per cent in March from 6.7 per cent at the end of 2013 . Apparently employers have more openings to fill because Baby Boomers are retiring and more workers are feeling confident enough about the economy to switch jobs . Overall , the United States generated 3.1 million jobs last year , the most since 1999 . In particular , employer demand for so-called STEM graduates - in science , technology , engineering and mathematics - was highest . Offering hope to non-STEM students , Gardner said of the future job market : ` There seems to be a lot of room for everybody ... Even arts and humanities are making a comeback . '
