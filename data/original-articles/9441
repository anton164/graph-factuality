Manchester United fear Daniel Levy will play hardball should they decided to pursue their interest in Hugo Lloris . And their worries look set to be realised with Spurs planning to slap a £ 35million price tag on the keeper to ward of his potential suitors , while the north London club are determined not to sell the Frenchman to a domestic rival . United are considering a move for the France goalkeeper as fears grow over a David de Gea 's future , while he is also a long-term target for Paris Saint-Germain . Hugo Lloris has established himself as one of the Premier League 's top keepers with some fine displays . Spurs are determined to keep Lloris at White Hart Lane and will put a £ 35million price tag on his head . But Spurs are determined to keep their No 1 at White Hart Lane and will demand a sky-high price for the keeper . The current world record transfer fee for a goalkeeper is the £ 32.6 million Juventus paid Parma for Gianluigi Buffon in 2001 . But Tottenham chairman Levy values Lloris even higher than that fee and wo n't consider any offers for a penny under £ 35million . And it is for that reason United , despite their interest , are already showing hesitancy regarding a summer switch . Daniel Levy -LRB- right -RRB- , alongside Spurs owner Joe Lewis , is known to drive a hard bargain . Gianluigi Buffon is the world 's most expensive keeper after his £ 32.6 m move from Parma to Juve in 2001 . Levy is known to be one of the toughest negotiators in Europe and will not let Lloris leave on someone else 's terms . His reputation for getting maximum value from the club 's assets was underlined when Real Madrid paid a world record £ 85million for Gareth Bale after a summer of hardball tactics from Levy . And the Spurs supremo will take a similar stance in their attempts to keep Lloris , who signed a five-year deal last summer .
