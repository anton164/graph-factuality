A hero pilot pulled his plane out of a terrifying North Sea nosedive with just seven seconds to spare . The plane began to plunge after it was struck by lightning , but autopilot ignored the pilot 's commands to climb and tried to crash the plane into the sea . The airliner pitched down , falling at 9,500 ft a minute , and fell to just 1,100 ft above the ocean before its commander wrestled back control just moments before it was about to crash into the icy water . The Loganair flight was just seconds from crashing into the north sea before its commander saved the day . The 42-year-old pilot put out a Mayday emergency signal before regaining control and saving his 30 passengers and three crew just moments before the plane plunged into the sea . The island-hopping Loganair flight from Aberdeen to Shetland was put off its approach by thunderstorms , snow , hail and 70mph winds on the evening of December 15 . A ball of lightning then appeared outside the cockpit and a lightning bolt struck the Saab 2000 plane 's nose , and then travelled the full length of the aircraft before leaving its tail . The aircraft landed safely in Aberdeen with only minor damage and no injuries . An AAIB probe discovered that the autopilot on the Loganair Saab 2000 G-LGNO had remained engaged and the pilot 's actions were countered by the system , causing the dive . No technical problems were found with the aircraft , which is now back in service , and pilot training is now included simulations of the incident according to the AAIB report .
