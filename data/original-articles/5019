No , ' defense attorney James Sultan said . ` He was a 23-year-old kid who witnessed ... a shocking killing committed by somebody he knew . He really did n't know what to do .

Prosecutors say the former tight end and two friends , Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz , picked up Lloyd at his Boston home before dawn on June 17 , 2013 , and drove him to an industrial park near Hernandez 's house in North Attleboro , Massachusetts , where they shot him to death .

But the defense said the prosecution 's case failed to prove Hernandez pulled the trigger . Prosecutors have never presented a motive to jurors and Sultan added on Monday that Hernandez and Lloyd were friends who shared ` a passion for marijuana ' . ` Obviously they were friends , ' Sultan told the jury . ` They were future brothers-in-law . ' Wallace and Ortiz have also pleaded not guilty to murder charges and will be tried separately . Both men used the drug PCP , according to attorneys and court documents , and the defense team has sought to link use of the drug with violent , unpredictable behavior in an apparent attempt to shift blame for the murder on the pair .

Sultan said that after nine weeks of testimony , prosecutors ` still have n't proved to you who killed Odin Lloyd . ' During the trial , which started in late January , the prosecution called 131 witnesses while the defense called three . Sultan also attacked the investigation , saying a shell casing removed from a rental car returned by Hernandez had been contaminated with his client 's DNA from a piece of chewing gum stuck to it . ` The investigation done in this case was incomplete , biased and inept . That was not fair to Odin Lloyd , that was not fair to Aaron Hernandez , and it was not fair to you , ' he said . ` All that effort and this is all they could come up with . What does that tell you ? ' Eighteen jurors began the trial in January , but three were dismissed , including one who is accused of misrepresenting her answers during screening in a bid to get onto the jury .
