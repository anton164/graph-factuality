Wasps will appeal against the three-week ban issued to Nathan Hughes , but their protest will not enable the back row to play in Sunday 's Champions Cup quarter-final against Toulon . The club have said in a statement they will appeal on the grounds the incident that left Northampton wing George North unconscious and resulted in a red card for Hughes was an accident and no foul play had occurred . With the hearing scheduled to be held next Friday , it means Hughes can not be reprieved in time to face the reigning European champions in Toulon this weekend . Wasps are set to appeal the three-match ban handed to No 8 Nathan Hughes for knocking out George North . North was out cold on the pitch at Franklin 's Gardens and had to be taken off on a stretcher . Hughes ' knee collided with North 's head as he crossed the line to score a try for Northampton . Hughes was given the suspension - to include three meaningful fixtures - after being found guilty of striking North in the 52-30 Aviva Premiership defeat at Franklin 's Gardens on March 27 . Commenting on the judgement made on Tuesday night , disciplinary officer Sir James Dingemans said : ` This was a three week ban on the basis that no intention was found . ` However , there was recklessness meaning that , notwithstanding the harm , it was a low entry point of four weeks with mitigation of one week to reflect his previous clean playing record . ' Wales winger North suffered a third confirmed concussion in just four months against Wasps last Friday .
