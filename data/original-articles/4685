A couple have been spared prison for felony child neglect after admitting to locking their three young children in a room with urine and feces for 24 hours a day - and feeding them through a gate . Scott Suggs , 28 , and Brandy Kangas , 36 , were arrested after police received an anonymous tip regarding the welfare of their children , a 17-month-old boy and two girls , aged three and four . When police arrived at their home in Fredericksburg , Virginia , last December , they discovered the youngsters locked in a ` sparsely furnished ' room , where they had seemingly ` remained at all times ' . The room was stained with human urine and feces and had a homemade ` gate ' , which the children appeared to have been fed their meals through . Authorities immediately removed the youngsters .
