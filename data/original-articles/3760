Britons are so confident of a scorching summer that bookmakers are receiving tens of thousands of pounds in bets on this year breaking records . The record for the hottest day ever in Britain was set more than a decade ago in August 2003 when temperatures hit 38.1 C -LRB- 101F -RRB- in Gravesend , Kent . Coral 's price on this summer being the hottest on record has fallen from 10/1 to 2/1 , while Ladbrokes has 5/6 on this spring being the warmest ever . There has been a surge in bets after the recent warm weather , and William Hill has 8/1 odds that the temperature will exceed 100F -LRB- 37.8 C -RRB- this year . Ladbrokes is also offering 8/1 that the April record of 29.4 C -LRB- 84.9 F -RRB- set in 1949 in Camden , north London , will be broken by the end of the month . The forecast for today is actually warmer than the 18C -LRB- 64F -RRB- average daytime temperature in August , and way ahead of the 11C -LRB- 52F -RRB- normally expected in April . This weekend will be slightly cooler than the dizzy heights expected tomorrow , but the clear skies and above-average temperatures are forecast to last well into next week . Met Office spokesman Laura Young said last night : ` We are expecting some really good temperatures over the next few days . Unless you are in north-west Scotland , which will see quite a lot of rain , it will be dry and sunny . ` On Tuesday we could see 23C to 25C -LRB- 73F to 77F -RRB- in prolonged sunshine . That is double the daytime average for this time of year . ` Wednesday will be 22C to 25C -LRB- 72F to 77F -RRB- or higher in places . Thursday will probably be slightly cooler but still in the high teens .

Among them were swimmers in the South-West who were stunned to see giant jellyfish in the waters . Barrel jellyfish , which have tentacles up to six feet long , were spotted near Hope Cove in south Devon . The species are usually found in the sunnier climes of the Mediterranean , but the rising temperatures and warmer seas have meant that more plankton becomes available and the jellyfish have headed closer to shore . The species is harmless to humans , but with the weather warming up then other jellyfish could be heading our way . Beachgoers are advised not to touch jellyfish in case they have chanced upon a species with a powerful sting . Devon vet Rupert Kirkwood , whose son Henry had an encounter with one of the jellyfish while kayaking , said : ` No doubt they are encouraged to put in an appearance by the sunny weather . I have never seen them so early in the year . Could be the start of a bumper jellyfish year .

The Met Office three-month contingency forecast for public officials predicts that there is an average chance of a warmer than usual summer . But thankfully the chances of it being much colder than usual is just 10 per cent . A spokesman said : ` Unfortunately , the weather we get in April does n't necessarily tell us anything about the kind of summer we can expect . ` We 're still in the midst of spring , so it 's far too early to say what the months of June , July and August may hold . ' Ladbrokes spokesman David Williams said yesterday : ` The money flooding in on weather bets is unusual and has taken us a bit by surprise . ` This is the first time we have seen quite significant sums wagered on this specific bet - so obviously people out there sense something hot is coming . ' And Nicola McGeady from Coral added : ` The British public are obsessed with the weather and that is reflected in the interest in weather betting .

El Nino - the warming of Pacific sea surface temperatures - can trigger drought in south-east Asia and Australia as well as floods in South America . The Met Office says most climate models ` now suggest that sea surface temperatures will exceed El Nino thresholds in late spring or early summer ' . With Britain set to bask in its hottest temperatures of the year so far this week , thousands of parents and children are expected to head to the beach . But firefighters have warned those thinking about stripping off and diving into the water - with more than 650 water-related deaths in the UK in 2013 . The act , known as ` tombstoning ' , can lead to people suffering ` cold water shock ' when the air temperature is much higher than that of the water . London Fire Brigade assistant commissioner Peter Cowup said : ` Rivers , lakes and canals may look inviting , especially on a hot day and after a drink . ` But it 's important to realise that open water has hidden dangers that can hurt you and at worse , kill you . ' On the first-ever Drowning Prevention and Water Safety Week , firefighters added that the 16-30 age group was worst-hit by water deaths in 2013 .

Vet Mr Kirkwood said : ` No doubt they -LSB- are -RSB- encouraged to put in an appearance by the sunny weather . ` I have never seen them so early in the year . Could be the start of a bumper jellyfish year . '
