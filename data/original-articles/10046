Now Mayweather will bank upwards of $ 180m , Pacquiao $ 120m . Now the whole wide world is waiting their collision with bated breath . On this frantic Tuesday , heavy security guarded the Mayweather Boxing Club for his media day .

Mayweather arrived , somewhat on the late side , in his new , state-of-the-art , very expensive Mercedes Party Bus .

Floyd was followed to work by an LAPD police car . Only this time they were not chasing the man who has had his run-ins with the law . They were guarding one of the most important assets of the city of Las Vegas , which stands to profit by billions in big fight week . All in the timing . ` This thing just grows and grows , ' says Mayweather . ` We now have one of the biggest fights ever in boxing history . And its not only about the money . ` One fight wo n't define my legacy . What about the 47 I 've already won ? ` It 's an important fight . It wraps everything together -- the money and my boxing . ` But if one fight defined everything this would be the only one I 'd have needed . ' And after this , he says , there will be only one more . Because it no longer amuses him like it did . ` I 'm pretty much done with all this , ' he tells a few of us summoned into a pocket in the middle of a crowd of people and cameras huge enough to do justice to a royal wedding . ` It 's not fun like it was back then , ' he explains . ` It 's business now .

Why always the MGM Grand Garden ? He grins , shakes a right wrist wrapped in a glittering diamond and gold bracelet . It reminds him of the first time tickets for a fight of his there sold out inside six minutes and he happened to mention he had noticed a bejewelled watch in a shop window at one of the MGM hotels . ` They just went and got it as a gift for me , ' he says . ` Ran to about $ 400,000 . ' He 's come a long way from the drug-strewn , gangland streets of Grand Rapids , Michigan where he grew up in poverty . But much as those baubles are stamped with the hallmarks of his journey to wealth and fame , Mayweather knows it was a human quality which made it possible . ` Loyalty , ' he says . ` Loyalty is the heartbeat of boxing . Whenever I need something the MGM get it for me . When I fight one of the biggest fights of all time , I take it to the MGM Grand Garden . ' The clamour around him never stops but there have been heavily hyped events like this before which have turned into anti-climax for the public . Will this one be worth the money , at $ 10,000 for a ringside seat rising to more than $ 200,000 on the black market , at virtually $ 100 per pay-per-view buy here in America ? It 's all in the timing : ` Our names are way bigger than five years ago . You have the two best in the world fighting each other , at the pinnacle of their careers . And our styles should work .

This is another fight for me . Yeah it 's big but basically it 's no different from all the others . Once we get in that ring it 's a level playing field . ` At my age -LRB- 38 -RRB- I 'm over getting nervous about an opponent . I 'm past getting wound up . What I have to do is get in that ring and be myself . Be the best Floyd Mayweather . ' That , he is sure , will be enough to win . The fight sells itself . But he carries a quiet air of confidence . There is much speculation about Pacquiao storming his fabled defence but he says : ` We 'll see . I know I can make adjustments to any fighter . Whatever he does , I can assess and make changes if I have to . ` I 'm calm , smooth , calculated and thinking five steps ahead of any opponent . But can he adjust ? He 's a reckless fighter . We saw that when he got knocked out by -LRB- Juan Manuel -RRB- Marquez . ' All in the timing ? Mayweather is grateful that Pacquiao has survived long enough to play his part in what is fast approaching a half-billion dollar extravaganza . ` If I fought as reckless as Manny , ' he says . ` I would n't be here today . I 'd be beaten up , worn out . I 've controlled my fights . ' Mayweather works the heavy bag with just over two weeks to go before he steps into the ring with Pacquiao .

Mayweather pauses and adds : ` If I had n't made that decision to be my own boss I would n't be where I will be in the Grand Garden on May 2 . ' Wherever he goes in his adopted home town , be it a booming casino , a heaving night club or his favourite fast food joint Fatburger on the Vegas Strip , Mr Money brews up a storm . One created by the nature of the desert blows into the marquee in which we are talking . Chairs and tables fly . As most of the group run for cover Mayweather plays pretend scared , then strolls into his gym . It seems nothing frightens this man who arrived for work this day in a convoy of ludicrously expensive vehicles . Not a Nevada sand storm . Not Typhoon PacMan blowing in from the Philippines .
