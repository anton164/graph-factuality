This is the ` disgusting ' serving of baked potato and corned beef served to an 81-year-old woman living in sheltered housing . Another meal Mr Ashton and his mother were unhappy with was a lasagne that was ` full of oil ' , he said . ` This was never to pick holes in the quality of care that they 're giving , it was just about the terrible food being served to the elderly people , ' Mr Ashton said . Mr Ashton took action when his mother said the meal looked so unappetising she did not want to eat it . ` I pulled that out of the fridge and it was just disgusting . It 's difficult to mess up a jacket potato and corned beef but there we have it - they did it . ' When Mr Ashton complained to Newport City Homes which is in charge of residents ' care but says he was told : ` That 's what your mother ordered . ' ` She might have ordered it because there was a lack of choice - but then it comes out and the corned beef looks dry and the jacket potato looks disgusting , ' he added . Other substandard meals to have been served include a lasagne ` full of oil ' , Mr Ashton said . Residents at Aneurin Bevan Court pay Â£ 42 a week for food . For that they are given two course-meals six days a week and and three-course meals on Sundays . Steve Ashton is now campaigning for changes to be made to ensure better food standards . His mother Joan , 81 , lives alone in the sheltered housing complex . But Mr Ashton is campaigning for more to be done to ensure standards are improved .
