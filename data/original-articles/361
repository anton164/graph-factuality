The brass lamp is being sold at auction in June by auctioneers Hansons -LRB- above with model in period costume -RRB- . A brass desk lamp used by Florence Nightingale as she wrote about her nursing experiences in the Crimean War is to be sold at auction . It was given as a gift to two sisters who worked as servants for the Nightingale family at Lea Hurst , near Matlock , Derbyshire . Dating back to around 1840 , the 10in tall lamp will go under the hammer at Hansons in Etwall , Derbyshire , on June 26 . After her experiences in the war Nightingale returned to Derbyshire , where she had spent her childhood , in the 1850s . She wrote of what she had seen in the conflict with her 1859 Notes on Nursing still considered as having shaped the profession today . During the war she became known as The Lady with the Lamp thanks to a report in The Times . She had been sent to Selimiye Barracks in Scutari , now Istanbul , in 1854 to care for soldiers . She pleaded with the British newspaper to appeal to the Government for better working conditions having been horrified by the squalor and disease fighters faced . The result was Renkioi Hospital , a civilian facility built in England and shipped to the area to care for those who had been hurt . It was there Nightingale earned her nickname , carrying a lamp as she completed rounds of the hospital 's patients through the night . The lamp from her Derbyshire home was passed down through generations of the Lea Hurst servants ' family . Auctineer Charles Hanson said : ` The lamp is quite remarkable . It has a wonderful provenance , which confirms it helped ignite Florence and her writings late into many a Derbyshire night . ` Such an iconic object and it 's association with such a leading lady will be guided at Â£ 1000-2000 . With interest and competition it may just ignite , since it is such a wonderful object . ' Florence Nightingale penned nursing notes at her Derbyshire home after returning from the Crimean War .
