Bayern Munich will be without midfielders Bastian Schweinsteiger and Franck Ribery when they travel to Porto for Wednesday 's Champions League quarter-final first leg . Frenchman Ribery is not yet fully fit following a five-week absence with an ankle injury while Schweinsteiger has had a virus for the past few days . ` Bastian and Franck will not be with us against Porto . That is bitter , ' sports director Matthias Sammer said on Monday as the problems started to pile up for the treble-chasing Bavarians . Bayern boss Pep Guardiola has a long injury list to contend with as he aims for domestic and European glory . Bastian Schweinsteiger lies injured on the pitch during Bayern 's 1-0 win against Borussia Dortmund on April 4 . Medhi Benatia , David Alaba , Javi Martinez and Arjen Robben had already been sidelined by injuries . Jerome Boateng , who was rested for Saturday 's 3-0 win over Eintracht Frankfurt due to a minor muscle problem , is back in the squad . ` Those who are with us have our full trust , ' Sammer told reporters ahead of the team 's departure for Portugal later on Monday . ` The team is hungry .
