Sam Allardyce has fired a warning to full back Aaron Cresswell - whose been linked with a move to Manchester City - that the grass is n't always greener and he should look at Jack Rodwell and Scott Sinclair as examples . The West Ham star has had a fine debut season in the Premier League , with a number of big clubs circling him for a possible summer move . But Allardyce believes that City 's previous British purchases speak volumes and that the 25-year-old should remain where he is . Aaron Cresswell -LRB- left -RRB- has been linked with a move to Manchester City but Sam Allardyce has warned him . He wrote in his Evening Standard column : ` What makes players like him attractive to big clubs is that he is home-grown and squads must have eight of those in the Premier League . ` Jack Rodwell and Scott Sinclair , for example , both spent time at City but did not play a great deal . ` They 're featuring more regularly now , for Sunderland and on loan at Aston Villa respectively , but the decision for a player like Sinclair is would he be willing to join another club on a permanent deal if it meant less money ? ' The left back scored a stunning free-kick last weekend against Stoke , as he showed his attacking prowess , as well as his defensive solidity . It remains to be seen if Cresswell will be at the club next season but with an England call-up being touted , West Ham may face a tough task of keeping their prized asset . Allardyce will be praying he can keep his prized asset from the clutches of the big clubs such as City . Cresswell scored a stunning free-kick against Stoke at Upton Park on Saturday to put them in front . Jack Rodwell -LRB- right -RRB- moved to City from Everton but struggled before leaving the club for Sunderland .
