World Snooker chairman Barry Hearn has rubbished rumours the Betfred World Championship will leave its spiritual home of Sheffield . This year marks the 40th anniversary of snooker 's most prestigious tournament at the Crucible Theatre , and there is interest from China in hosting the event . But Hearn has revealed he is close to extending deals with Sheffield City Council , and broadcast partner the BBC , both of which expire in 2017 . Barry Hearn has dismissed rumours the Betfred World Championship will leave Sheffield . ` We ai n't going to China , period ! ' said Hearn . ` On my tombstone I 'm not having `` This is the man who took snooker out of Sheffield '' . ` I 'm quite close to extending the BBC agreement and I would sign a 20-year deal with Sheffield City Council if they wanted to sit down with me . ' Meanwhile , tournament favourite Ronnie O'Sullivan has said he would love to equal Steve Davis 's haul of six Crucible crowns . But the Rocket , a five-time champion , is worried whether his game is up to scratch for this year 's event . Snooker fans arrive at the Crucible before the opening day of the Betfred World Championships . ` I am very competitive and I want a sixth and even a seventh world title , ' said O'Sullivan . ` But it is such a long tournament to stay focused and keep form . ' John Higgins took a 6-3 lead in his first-round match with Robert Milkins on Saturday , while Anthony McGill went 6-3 up against Stephen Maguire . Ronnie O'Sullivan plays a shot in his semi-final against Judd Trump during the Betfair World Championships .
