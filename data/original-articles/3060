This extraordinary video - captured when a skydiver dropped his GoPro camera at 10,000 ft - shows what it is like to freefall to the ground . The clip shows the very moment the helmet camera becomes detached and makes its dizzying descent back to earth . After what begins as a routine skydive - with two of the jumpers linking hands in mid-air as two companions circle them - the camera slips from helmet and makes its stomach-churning plunge to the ground . It spins quickly to the ground for a minute and a half before crashing into a field . Remarkably , the camera remains intact despite falling from the great height . The video was taken of a routine skydive in Everöd , Sweden and recorded on the helmet of one of the divers . A Go Pro video shows the skydivers linking arms as they jumped out of the plane at 10,000 feet . As two of the divers continue to link hands , their two friends circle them as they free fall from the plane . At that moment , the Go Pro camera from one of the diver 's helmets becomes detached and falls to the ground . The camera was discovered by Kristoffer Örstadius 's father in a meadow in Gringelstad outside Kristianstad , Sweden . It is believed the footage was taken four years ago and Kristoffer uploaded the footage in the hope of finding its owner . After posting the video to YouTube , the owner was located in Everöd , Sweden . It has amassed more than 250,000 views since it was uploaded to the site . Once detached , it whizzes to the ground - taking one and a half minutes to hit the ground . The camera continues to record as it spins out of control , and captures some dizzying footage . As the camera plummets to the earth , the footage of the free fall becomes even more blurry . Eventually , the camera crashes into the ground in thick grass - remarkably it remained intact .
