UEFA and FIFA say that is direct government interference in football and have threatened to suspend Greece . Panathinakos ' game against Olympiakos in February was marred by crowd trouble in Athens . Greek government have proposed new laws banning teams from European competitions , but UEFA general secretary Gianni Infantino says they are not allowed to directly interfere with football . Infantino said : ` Sadly there will be no other choice than to suspend the Greek Football Federation if this new legislation is passed because football does not allow government interference . ` There are currently three other countries , outside of Europe , which are currently facing similar issues - Indonesia , Pakistan and Zimbabwe . I think people in Greece should be very concerned because a suspension will have a serious impact on their football . ` Do n't forget that it will affect more than the national team . If your clubs do n't play in our competitions , their coefficient will also drop , meaning that less teams can qualify for the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League . ' UEFA and FIFA sent a final letter of warning on Wednesday but the Greek government is refusing to back down . Greece 's deputy sports minister Stavros Kontonis told Greek television on Wednesday night : ` We are not going to change the philosophy of the sports bill .
