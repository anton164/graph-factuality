Most people expect stunning views from the Empire State Building or the sound of waves meeting golden sands when their partner pops the question . One lucky woman will forever associate one of the happiest days of her life with burgers and fries . This video captures the moment her boyfriend got down on one knee and popped the question inside the McDonald 's restaurant where she works . The man drops down on one knee as he proposes to his girlfriend inside a McDonald 's restaurant . Egged on by his friends , the man , known only as Chase , strides purposefully over to his girlfriend , who is wearing her uniform , and drops down on one knee . Many women would probably beg their beau to move a more scenic location before getting the ring out , but the woman is clearly delighted , quickly saying ` Yes ' . He then places a diamond ring on her finger . The couple then engage in a passionate embrace by the food counter . The young couple embraces after she said ` yes ' -LRB- left -RRB- ; the woman shows off her diamond ring -LRB- right -RRB- . Meanwhile their friends filming the video , shot in an undisclosed city in the US , whoop and yell : ` Man this is real , this really is real ' . One of them says ` We are in McDonald 's ' and calls for free Happy Meals for the happy couple . The video ends with the bride-to-be turning down the offer of a free meal before leaving the fast food chain with her fiance . Last year , McDonald 's in Hong Kong revealed so many couples wanted to walk through the golden arches instead of down the aisle they had launched their own wedding service .
