Hairdresser Tain Yeh , 42 , who runs a parlour in Taipei said : ` I am aware of the trend although we do n't have much request for it here because it 's very difficult to keep the shape . ` It came about because people were always looking for more impressive haircuts , and somebody came up with the idea of shaping the dog like a hedge . ' Pictures of doe-eyed dogs with their shapely new cuts have proved extremely popular online prompting more owners to seek out the custom salons .
