' Anne Frank 's diary recounts how her family went into hiding from the Nazis in the Netherlands during the Second World War . It became a bestseller when it was published at the end of the war . The book documents how Anne , her sister Margot and her family went into hiding in a canal house . They were eventually betrayed and sent to Bergen-Belsen , where she and her sister died . After the war the Dutch government set the official date of Anne 's death as March 31 , based on survivors accounts stating that the girls died sometime in March . But some accounts suggest that she might have died in the middle of February - just two months before British soldiers liberated the camp . It is likely she caught typhus , which was rife in the overcrowded camp . Her sister Margot also passed away and experts think she too had the disease . Their grave , which reads Margot Frank 1926 - 1945 and Anne Frank 1929 - 1945 , is a poignant memorial that still stands where the Nazi camp used to be . Red and white roses , yellow tulips and stones were laid carefully around the grave earlier today .

Some of the survivors brought small , colourful bunches of flowers and laid them on plaques on the ground alongside other tributes .

British soldiers freed around 60,000 prisoners but discovered tens of thousands of bodies of people who had died from extreme overcrowding , disease and starvation . Typhus , which Miss Frank is thought to have died from , was particularly rife . Ceremonies have been held across Germany and Poland throughout the spring marking the advance of Allied troops as Nazi Germany neared defeat . They are even more poignant this year because of the dwindling number of survivors and witnesses to the Holocaust , the murder of six million Jews by the regime of Adolf Hitler . Ceremonies were also taking place today at the former Flossenb√ºrg camp in southern Germany , where around 30,000 people died between 1938 and 1945 .
