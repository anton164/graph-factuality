Inter Milan manager Roberto Mancini insists that reports Xherdan Shaqiri is set to leave the club this summer are ` completely made up ' . The Switzerland international joined the Italians from Bayern Munich in January for a fee in the region of Â£ 12million , signing a four-and-a-half year contract . The 23-year-old made a fine start to his Inter career but has tailed off in recent weeks and has found himself dropped to the bench for the previous two Serie A matches . Xherdan Shaqiri joined Inter Milan from Bayern Munich in the January transfer window . And it has been suggested that Inter are looking to offload the attacking midfielder at the end of the season , but Mancini has rubbished the speculation insisting Shaqiri can have a big future in Italy . ` This Shaqiri thing is completely made up , ' he told reporters . ` We bought Shaqiri last January because we think that he can have a big future at Inter . Then during the season , there might be a moment when a player 's form drops , and there are other players that in that moment are able to step in . So that 's the only situation going on right now . ` Shaqiri has our full confidence . He is our player . Then he has also changed his team , so it 's normal that he might struggle at a certain stage . Shaqiri has been dropped to the bench by Roberto Mancini in recent matches . ` It 's not that he can join a new club and altogether be the one that single-handedly wins games by himself . ` He will always have a drop in form at a certain stage so in that moment there are other players ready to step in - they are normally there for that reason . So one only plays when he deserves to play . ` We bought Shaqiri because we believe in his qualities , ' Mancini added . The Inter boss insists Shaqiri will not be leaving the club despite reports to the contrary . ` Then if Bayern -LSB- Munich -RSB- decided to sell him , it 's because they have so many players that eventually they have reached the conclusion that Shaqiri is a young player and that he needs to play . ` Inter could be the right solution for him and we are happy about this . I am sure that Shaqiri next season will achieve great things . '
