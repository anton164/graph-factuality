Speaking for the first time about the attack , Ms McCartney , a legal PA from Greenbank in Edinburgh , said : ` I used to love going out on Saturday nights . But since the attack I have been very wary and like to be home by a certain time . ` I do n't like to go out to nightclubs now and I get very panicky in crowds after this unprovoked attack . ` I 'm on sleeping tablets from a doctor because I do n't sleep at all . I still have this constant reminder and feel I ca n't move on because I still have the injuries from that night . I 'm reminded every day of this attack .

' In a text message , which Ms McCartney said had been sent by Heatlie to her partner , the trainer wrote : ` Please pass on my sincerest apologies to your partner Fiona , I wanted to get in touch but obviously could n't with the case proceedings . ` This incident , that I have virtually no memory of , has turned my life upside down and I ca n't imagine how it has impacted Fiona 's . ` I am so sorry , this is completely out of character for me , I 've never been involved in a violent incident in my adult life . ' Heatlie used an endorsement from Stefani to help promote his new studio when it opened six years ago . At the time , she described Heatlie as being ` completely passionate about health and fitness ' . She said : ` I 'm so happy for Mike that he 's opening his own studio . I know it will be a huge success . I ca n't wait to start working with him again in preparation for our summer tour . ` Mike is completely passionate about health and fitness and is a wonderful motivator . ` He is tireless , compassionate and makes working out something to look forward to . He is the Superman of my tour . '
