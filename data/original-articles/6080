Everton 's Steven Pienaar has admitted he considered retirement as frustration took its toll during his injury-ravaged season . The influential 33-year-old midfielder Pienaar has been dogged by groin and knee injuries this season limiting him to just 11 appearances . He returned to action from his latest setback in the 1-1 draw with Swansea City earlier this month but muscle fatigue ruled him out of the win over Burnley last weekend . Everton midfielder Steven Pienaar is held back by Swansea 's Ki Sung-Yueng at the Liberty Stadium . Pienaar said : ` At one stage , I thought I had better just hang my boots up and call it a day but on the other side I was just thinking that I enjoy going in and seeing the guys so I just had to stay strong and that kept me going . ` When you are at home not coming in for training you feel very down but as soon as I walk through the door , there 's always the camaraderie in the group , there is always fun . ` Even if you are injured , you can always laugh and it keeps you going . Just to be among the players , it 's kept me going . ' Pienaar has made just 11 appearances for the Toffees this season due to groin and knee injuries .
