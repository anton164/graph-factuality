Teenage Aldi worker Christian Trousedale became an internet hit after a picture of him carrying a 95-year-old pensioner 's shopping home went viral . A teenage Aldi worker says he is ` blown away ' by the public reaction after a picture of him carrying a 95-year-old pensioner 's shopping home went viral . Christian Trousedale , 18 , walked the elderly man to his front door , holding his hand as they made their way to his home in Horwich , near Bolton . His act of kindness was seen by Samantha-Jayne Brady , who stopped them to take a picture which she then posted on Facebook . The picture of Mr Trousedale and the pensioner has been ` liked ' a quarter of a million times and shared by 70,000 people . It 's attracted attention from all over the world , with more than 50,000 shares in Dubai , Australia , the United States and elsewhere . Christian said he was ` blown away ' by the reaction to an act of kindness that was ` just something I would normally do ' . He added : ` The reaction has been completely crazy , my facebook is just overflowing with messages , I ca n't even start to read them all . ` One woman posted on my wall from America saying that she wished there were more people in her country like me , it has been really amazing . ` I went back into Aldi this afternoon and a lady came up and hugged me and said she loved what I had done . ' Christian had spotted the 96-year-old about to make the journey alone and on foot in strong winds so asked his superiors if he could offer some help . Mr Trousedale , a college student who works part-time as a stock assistant at the supermarket , told the Bolton News that he did not consider his actions extraordinary , and that he had been brought up to respect his elders . He said : ` I asked my manager if it was OK to walk him home and he said that was the right thing to do , so I did . ` We had a good chat about everything from the General Election to the history of Horwich - he knew lots about everything . ' ` It is very strange because this is just something I would normally do , my parents have raised me to treat other people like you want to be treated yourself , ' he said . The picture of Mr Trousedale and the pensioner has been ` liked ' a quarter of a million times and shared by 70,000 people . Onlooker Miss Brady , who works in a fish and chip shop near the supermarket , said she posted the picture because she was taken aback by Christian 's ` selfless , thoughtful and caring gesture ' . She wrote : ` Need to share this , whilst working earlier we watched this lovely lad walking this little old man home . ` He was n't very agile , nor fast but Christian walked with him ever so patiently and slowly , chatted along with him and carried his bag for him . ` It was a lovely thing to witness and they seemed to be having a good chit-chat along their way . ` High 5 to Aldi for letting him do this and high 5 to Christian from Aldi in Horwich for his selfless , thoughtful & caring gesture ! ` I desperately want this lad to get some kind of recognition from his workplace so if this gave you a little more faith in mankind PLEASE share ! Good people still exist . ' Both Mr Trousedale , who works at the Aldi -LRB- pictured -RRB- in Horwich , near Bolton , and Miss Brady 's Facebook pages have been flooded with praise . Miss Brady said she wanted to share the image and story because she feels that not enough positive stories about young people are shared around . She added : ` There are so many negative stories about young people but the positive ones just are n't seen on a large scale . ' Miss Brady received a bottle of wine and a bunch of flowers from Aldi as a thank you for spreading the 18-year-old 's good deed . Both Mr Trousedale and Miss Brady 's Facebook pages have been flooded with praise since the photograph was taken on Friday . Among the messages of support posted online was this one from Jackie Bleszinski , who wrote : ` How lovely , glad to see there are still good people around and refreshing to hear about it instead of usual doom and gloom . ' Daphne Stephens posted : ` Oh so well done - bet your parents and relations are super proud of you , I know I would be . ' Mr Trouesdale 's mother , Lynda , responded to the many positive comments about her son by stating : ` Thank you everyone for your kind and beautiful words , they have touched me and my husband very much . ` It 's been rewarding and emotional reading people 's lovely comments . We as a family are very close and me and my husband are extremely proud of our sons and how they have turned out to be . '
