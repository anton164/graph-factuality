Despite their best efforts , a 10-man Arsenal Under-21s side fell to a 3-2 defeat by Middlesbrough at the Riverside Stadium on Monday night . Gunners goalkeeper Deyan Iliev was sent off inside 15 minutes after he scythed down Boro 's Harry Chapman in the box , having failed to clear George Dobson 's back pass . Emmanuel Ledesma converted the resulting penalty past substitute stopper Matt Macey . Arsenal 's Ainsley Maitland-Niles -LRB- right -RRB- tussles for possession with Middlesbrough 's Ryan Robbel -LRB- left -RRB- . Arsenal 's Daniel Crowley -LRB- right -RRB- dribbles with the ball ahead of Middlesbrough 's Callum Cooke -LRB- left -RRB- on Monday . Alex Iwobi then equalised for Arsenal , netting his sixth goal in his last four games , but the hosts built up a two-goal lead before half-time through screamers from Lewis Maloney and Yanic Wildschut . Maloney 's effort , a fine solo run , before a thunderbolt shot from long-range was matched by a similar quality strike from Wildschut , who can also boast two first-team goals this term as well . Daniel Crowley pulled one back for Arsenal on the hour mark but the fight back proved to be too little too late . Crowley had scored a last-minute winner in October in the campaign 's reverse fixture , but on Monday , Boro were able to exact their revenge and consolidated their position at the top of the Barclays Under-21s Premier League Division Two . Arsenal , meanwhile , have lost their last two games in succession , failing to muster a response to the 1-0 defeat by Reading last week . Matt Macey had to come on for Arsenal after starting goalkeeper Deyan Iliev was sent off inside 15 minutes .
