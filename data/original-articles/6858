England World Cup hopeful Elliot Daly has been named the Aviva Premiership 's player of the month for March . The uncapped Wasps centre , 22 , scored two tries in March as the Coventry-based club maintained on course for a Champions Cup spot next season . Equally comfortable at full back , Daly 's form at centre has him pushing incumbent England No 13 Jonathan Joseph hard for his place . Elliot Daly is handed his player of the month award by Wasps director of rugby Dai Young . He looks certain to be included in Stuart Lancaster 's England 's World Cup training squad named next month . Wasps director of rugby Dai Young said : ` If England are going to go out and win the Rugby World Cup , he 's the type of player you 've got to have in the team so I 'd certainly like to think he 's pushing for a place in the squad . ' BT Sport analyst Austin Healey added : ` For a good couple of years now us rugby watchers have known of the potential of Elliot Daly . Daly is mobbed by his team-mates after scoring a try against Saracens at the Ricoh Arena . ` Over the last few months we have seen him realise it and perhaps with plenty still to come . ' A talented sportsman educated at Whitgift School in Croydon - who also produced England internationals Danny Cipriani and Marland Yarde - Daly was offered a contract with Surrey Cricket before opting for a career in rugby . He has appeared four times for England Saxons . The Wasps centre looks set to be called into England 's training squad for the World Cup .
