A mother has filmed the moment her five-year-year girl decided to give her a telling-off about the ` mess ' in their house and her brother 's bad behaviour . Saige , five , who 's from the US , concludes the passionate rant by declaring she will move out and stay with her mum 's best friend : ` I 'm moving on , I 'm going to Jenn 's ! ' Unfortunately for her , her mother refuses to take the threat seriously and just laughs at her daughter , responding : ` No you 're not . ' Scroll down for video . ` I 'm MOVING ! ' says five-year-old Saige , who has had enough of living with her mother for five years . In the video titled , ` Saige is mad and she 's moving on ' , the determined little girl , gives her mother a stern nod and replies : ` Yes I am ! ' When her mother - who has n't revealed her name but posts videos under YouTube channel Fourth St. James - asks her why she has to move out , Saige says she 's been in the house ` way too long ... for , like , five years ' . She tells her mother what 's behind her bad mood , explaining : ` I need to move on sometimes ' . Saige then adds : ` I will make Jenn 's house as clean as I can make it . Her mother replies : ` Why ca n't you make my house clean ? ' ` Because I do n't love you , ' says Saige , ` This is way dirty , it has no space . My room is a disaster , it has no room and I can barely have room to put my stuff . ' ` If Tanner wants me to move , I 'm moving ! ' says Saige , who is upset with her brother for throwing dirt at her . Her brother Tanner - with whom she is ` mad ' - teases : ` What are you going to do at Jenn 's house ? ' Defiant Saige says : ` I have lots of stuff . I 'm moving on ! ' ` I 'm going to miss you ! ' says mum . ` If Tanner wants me to move , I 'm moving ! ' says Saige . She says she does n't care if her mum is sad , and that she will move to Jenn 's ` probably after tomorrow ' . Her brother throwing dirt at her is also partly to blame . The state of the house is also a problem . ` This is way dirty , it has no space . My room is a disaster , ' says Saige .
