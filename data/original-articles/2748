Many popular Easter eggs contain more sugar than is recommended in a day by the World Health Organisation . There is nothing as synonymous with Easter as chocolate eggs . A survey released this week found the average child will eat eight of the chocolate treats , totalling a massive 8,000 calories over the long weekend . But while the holiday might be a child 's favourite , a nutritionist has warned too much sugar can lead to obesity , type 2 diabetes and tooth decay . Dr Sam Christie , a nutrition scientist , also warned too much of the sweet stuff can exacerbate polycystic ovarian syndrome and behavioural problems like ADHD . The World Health Organisation recommends 50g of added sugar a day -LRB- roughly 12 and a half teaspoons -RRB- , on top of natural sugars that occur in fruit and milk . Dr Christie has calculated that many popular eggs contain more than the recommended daily amount of sugar . Nestle Crunch Medium Easter Egg contains 182 per cent of the recommended daily amount , while a Thorntons Cupcake Medium Easter Egg has 161 per cent . Depending on how physically active the children are , eating too much sugar could trigger insulin resistance , Dr Christie said . This is where the body becomes de-sensitised to insulin , the hormone that controls how much sugar is in the bloodstream . Over time this slowly damages cells and organs in the body , and leads to type 2 diabetes . She said : ` Sugar causes pathological changes , their bodies become resistant to insulin and have cellular damage to all parts of the body . ' It also leads to weight gain . ` Insulin resistance puts you at a metabolic disadvantage to lose weight . It actually becomes very hard to lose weight once the body ca n't break down sugar , ' she explained . ` Dermatologists used to say `` chocolate and sugar does n't harm skin '' . Now they are saying ` yes they do ' . She added children could also become deficient in other nutrients too . She said : ` If someone 's overstraining their insulin system they lose more nutrients in urine , as do trace elements like zinc . They fall into deficit . ` You can upset metabolism by having too much sugar . ' Eating too much sugar can lead to obesity , type 2 diabetes , tooth decay , nutrient deficiencies , acne and behavioural problems , a nutritionist warns . This can also lead to other deficiencies as children may fill up on sugar but not eat other , more nutritious food , so they miss out on vitamins and minerals , she added . Having a healthy diet the rest of the year can actually protect against the damaging effects of insulin resistance , which sugar might trigger . ` Eat wholegrains , fruit and veg , portions of oil rich fish - the nutrients in foods will help make the body more sensitive to insulin . ` If someone takes multi-vitamins , it helps sensitise the body to insulin , so you 're more likely to burn off sugar . ` We fail to eat our micronutrients every day and it can actually help the nation become less obese . ' She added that if a person is going to overindulge , solid chocolate eggs are better for health than ones with sugary fillings . She said : ` Any of the ones with pure chocolate rather than squidgy fillings are better . ` I 'd avoid fondant or caramel , and go for solid chocolate . ` Then you 'll be eating more polyphenols and less added sugar . ` The squidgy ones have added sugar on top of the sugar in cocoa . ' Eating a small treat , rather than gorging on multiple eggs , allows children to enjoy easter without risking their health , she continued . She said : ` Eat a crème egg or a solid egg 's worth , something that can sit on your child 's hand instead of covering their entire dinner plate . ' Dr Christie recommends Nature 's Best Multi-Guard Balance vitamin supplement , which has added chromium , cinnamon bark and magnesium and claims to stave off sugar cravings and boost energy levels .
