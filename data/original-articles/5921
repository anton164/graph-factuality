Fernando Torres has played with some great players over the years but the on-loan Atletico Madrid striker regards Steven Gerrard as the best . Torres spent three-and-half-seasons at the English club and struck up a close friendship with the former England captain , even returning to Anfield to play in his charity match against Jamie Carragher 's side . Since leaving the club in 2011 , Torres has never quite found his best form - suffering a miserable time with Chelsea before signing for AC Milan and returning to Atletico on loan . He has scored four times since heading back to Spain in January . Fernando Torres -LRB- left -RRB- and Steven Gerrard became good friends during his successful career at Liverpool . He told Marca Plus Magazine : ` Out of all the great players I have played with , Gerrard , for me , is the best . ` But he is more than that - he is a good friend who , as a captain , is always there for his players . ` I know what Liverpool means to him , so yes I would have loved to see my friend finish his final season with a trophy , but it was not to be . ` He has had so much success for Liverpool that I am sure the final game is going to be very emotional for him and the fans . ' Torres ' new side travel to rivals Real Madrid for a place in the Champions League semi-final on Wednesday , knowing that they have n't lost to their neighbours in the previous six matches . The 31-year-old has struggled for form since leaving the club and has only scored four goals for Atletico .
