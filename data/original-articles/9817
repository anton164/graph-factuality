Southampton striker Graziano Pelle insists his confidence has n't been destroyed despite no scoring in the Premier League since December 20 . The 29-year-old , who netted against England for Italy in the 1-1 international friendly on Tuesday , is now hoping to return to the form that saw him plunder eight goals in his first 17 league games . The former Feyenoord star has thanked Saints fans for continuing to support him through his lean spell , while manager Ronald Koeman has backed Pelle to go on a run during the final eight games of the campaign . Graziano Pelle remains confident despite not scoring in his last 13 Premier League games . The Italy striker celebrates after netting the opener in Tuesday 's 1-1 friendly draw with England . ` I was happy to play in a nice stadium it 's a great team to play against . I like those games . I was happy , especially because I scored , ' he told Southampton 's official website . ` For Southampton I got the chances , but I did n't profit about it . I 'm not a person who thinks negative . I have a great job and all I can do is work more and more when something is going wrong . ` That way I can achieve what I want to do . When you perform well the goals can come . It 's not only about scoring the goal , I want to do well for the team in general . Pelle last scored in the Premier League during Southampton 's 3-0 defeat of Everton on December 20 . ` I 'm really happy for the support they give me . I said I have to try and bring the supporters to my side when I joined , in the beginning not many people knew me . ` I did well and then everyone was behind me . Then it has gone a bit wrong and some people can think he 's not good enough , but the stadium every time they make me feel good . ` I have to say thanks to them , I want to do my job as good as possible . I 'm double happy if I score but I just want to think about the future , we have eight games left . '
