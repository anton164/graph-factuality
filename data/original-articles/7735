Danny Willett gave a rules official , who had been in his line-of-sight , a verbal blast which was clearly audible to spectators surrounding the 17th green at the Masters on Thursday . Englishman Willett vented his anger after his second shot from beyond the green trickled all the way across the putting surface and left the preacher 's son facing a bogey or worse . ` Of anyone you should know the rules , ' Willett shouted loudly at the official , who was sitting about 60 yards away in a golf cart , outside the gallery ropes . Danny Willett waits to play a shot on the fifth during the first round at 2015 Masters on Thursday . The 27-year-old Englishman carded a one-under 71 during his first ever round at Augusta . Willett was still visibly angry as he left the green after salvaging a bogey , though he had calmed down by time he spoke to reporters about 30 minutes later . He said his ire had been raised because the official had been in his line-of-sight as he was preparing to play his shot . ` We were being timed -LRB- for slow play -RRB- , which I can appreciate , ' Willett said after carding a one-under 71 at Augusta National . ` It 's a little bit tricky out here , so it takes a little bit of time , but you 'd like to think the referee that 's timing you knows exactly where to put his buggy and where not to put his buggy . ' Willett , 27 , a two-time European Tour winner , is playing in his first Masters . Willett was left frustrated with a rules official for getting in his line-of-sight during his round .
