Boss Nigel Pearson has urged Leicester to keep their cool and ignore their relegation rivals . The Foxes host Swansea on Saturday just three points from safety in the Barclays Premier League after back-to-back wins . Last week 's 3-2 win at West Brom handed them a survival lifeline , although they remain bottom of the table . Jamie Vardy scored an injury-time winner against West Bromwich Albion on Saturday to improve his side 's slim chance of Premier League survival . Vardy celebrates in front of the travelling away fans after hitting the winner against West Brom . But after their mini-revival , Pearson wants his side to remain focused on their own jobs . ` I 'm very wary of people flipping the emphasis , ' he said . ` Our future is in our own hands and if we go into the last game with that we have given ourselves a realistic chance . ` We need to make sure our own run-in is what we want it to be . Leicester manager Nigel Pearson has urged his players to focus on their own job and not worry about their relegation rivals during run-in . ` It 's helpful that other teams are being dragged into it . People are continually adjusting the form table and their predictions . ` We ca n't get involved in anything apart from being involved in our own games that may change people 's perceptions . ` It 's great when results go your way but they only help if you 've done your own job . ` It 's important for us to be in touch . One of the potential problems we have to deal with is people are now overly optimistic . '
