Justin Rose is not resting on his laurels after his impressive Masters 2015 display and is continuing his training ahead of his next PGA tour event - on his state-of-the-art indoor golf simulator . Joint runner-up with Phil Mickelson , the Englishman was delighted with his performance , as he pushed winner Jordan Speith all the way on the final day and earned himself a hefty pay-day . Rose , however , is already looking ahead to his next outing and posted a photograph on Twitter , showing his followers his high-tech ` TrackMan Indoor High Definition Golf Simulator . ' Justin Rose is back training and was pictured using his state-of-the-art £ 30,000 indoor simulator . His caption read : ` Week at home working on my game before my next event on the #PGAtour . ' The simulator gives the opportunity to practice in HD and includes such wind conditions to elevation levels , as it lets players practice their games inside their own homes , with incredible accuracy . It does n't come cheap though and will set you back around £ 30,000 to have one installed . Rose was in top form during the Masters and pushed winner Jordan Speith all the way at Augusta .
