Mr Mole , AP McCoy 's mount in the Grade One Celebration Chase at Sandown on Saturday , has been installed as one of three 7-2 co-favourites in the seven-runner line-up . Paul Nicholls-trained Mr Mole is bracketed with Irish raider Special Tiara and Nicky Henderson 's Sprinter Sacre , who will be ridden by Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Nico de Boinville in the absence of injured Barry Geraghty . AP McCoy and Mr Mole will have six rivals in the Grade One Celebration Chase at Sandown on Saturday . Mr Mole will be McCoy 's last ride in a Grade One race . His book of rides for his final day as a professional jockey will not be finalised until Friday morning . Ironically , it was after riding Mr Mole to victory at Newbury in February that McCoy shocked the racing world by announcing his intention to quit riding . Other runners in the Celebration Chase include Mick Channon 's Somersby .
