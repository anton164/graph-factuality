Despite Arsenal winning their eighth Premier League game in a row on Saturday , the club 's chief executive Ivan Gazidis says he is ` not happy ' that the club are not going to win the title . With top spot set to elude Arsenal again , Gazidis says the club will ` keep pushing ' Chelsea , but he admitted winning the championship is unlikely . And Gazidis fears Arsenal will find it harder in future just to maintain their perennial place in the top four Champions League qualification places due to a surge in television cash . Aaron Ramsey smashes the ball home in the win over Burnley , Arsenal 's eighth victory in a row in the league . Francis Coquelin wins the ball off George Boyd as the Gunners moved four points clear in second place . Gazidis says the Premier League is ` going to become more competitive which is going to be more challenging for clubs like us . ' The Gunners have n't won the league since 2004 and their first eight-game winning run since then has propelled them to second . Earlier setbacks , though , for Arsene Wenger 's team helped Chelsea to establish a commanding lead . ` we are not happy but we are going to keep pushing to the end and see how far we can go , ' said Gazidis . Ivan Gazidis says he is not happy with second place , and says the club may struggle in the near future .
