The 27-year-old , who came on as a substitute in the 23rd minute of Thursday 's match , told the Daily Star Sunday : ` I was surprised how calm I was , with everything going through my head about doing the right things . Ben Flower does not believe he deserved the standing ovation which greeted his return from suspension . ` But I did n't expect such a big loud roar and a standing ovation . For the fans to stick by me like that is a credit to them . ` It was lovely for them to do that but at the end of the day I do not deserve that because I let the club down massively . ' Ahead of Flower 's return , coach Shaun Wane had said he wanted to see him come back an even more aggressive player , but Flower said he needed to learn how to manage his emotions . ` I will get back to being a more aggressive player as I get fitter but aggressive does not mean that I am going to be a dirty player , ' he said . ` What happened in the Grand Final was a massive mistake .
