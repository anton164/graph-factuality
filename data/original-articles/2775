Despite the initial hype surrounding the launch of Periscope , Twitter 's iPhone app , which is being touted as a revolutionary new way to share news , there are already a concerning number of users , particularly women , reporting that they have been sexually harassed , or trolled . Justin Esgar , App Developer of the app Goodnight , told FEMAIL that because Periscope ` allows users to share even more of their intimate lives with each other than ever before ' , there are ` apparent dangers ' that users have to consider before accessing it . Special features : The app , which is owned by Twitter , allows users to follow certain people -LRB- L -RRB- and scroll through a ` Watch ' feed of live videos -LRB- R -RRB- . Emma Barker , sex and relationships editor at Cosmopolitan.com , noted that the app is already crawling with men who are using the anonymity afforded to them by the app 's settings in order to sexually harass women - including one of her female friends . She explained that her friend recently tried out the app by sharing a conversation she was having with her female roommate . They were fully clothed , sitting on a couch and casually conversing , yet ` within the first 20 seconds the first comment popped up ' , asking for the women to ` show butt ' . While neither of them were speaking in an even remotely sexual manor , the lewd comments continued to pour in and included phrases such as : ` Show boobs ' , ` Age ? ' and ` I would soooo swipe right on both -LSB- sic -RSB- ! ' Streaming revolution : Periscope , an iPhone app that allows users to broadcast live video and audio to the internet , launched last Thursday . One particularly creepy user asked : ` Do you get out of the shower to pee ? ' According to Periscope 's community guidelines , the app prohibits ` pornographic or overtly sexual content ' as well as ` explicitly graphic content or media that is intended to incite violent , illegal or dangerous activities ' . And while a spokesperson for the app told Emma that Periscope has a team dedicated to content review , there does n't appear to be anything specific being done to prevent sexual commentary and online harassment . The app 's policies are , unsurprisingly , similar to Twitter , which is currently testing out a ` quality filter ' that monitors and removes threats and offensive language out of users notifications feeds . It 's not clear as to whether or not Periscope will be given a similar screening system .
