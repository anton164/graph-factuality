Tyga , who has been making headlines during the last few months for dating the youngest Kardashian sister - 17-year-old Kylie Jenner , appeared to dye his hair red to show his support to Arsenal .

Tyga , who is currently touring around the UK , appeared to be delighted with his gift as the 25-year-old music artist was all smiles as he was snapped alongside Oxlade-Chamberlain .
