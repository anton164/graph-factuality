David Axelrod : Two presidential triumphs in the US . Behind David Axelrod 's self-confessed ` tired and rumpled ' appearance lies one of the sharpest political brains of his generation . He won fame in the US after helping to convince Americans to pick their first black president in 2008 and then helped Barack Obama 's re-election four years later . But the two presidential triumphs are only the highest profile in a string of Democrat successes that have made the 60-year-old New Yorker a back room political superstar . It began 30 years ago when , fresh from quitting his job as the youngest ever political editor of the Chicago Tribune , he helped oust a three-term Republican senator for Illinois . Three years later , he was a key member of the team that helped re-elect Chicago 's first black mayor Harold Washington . But he has not been as successful in Europe . Former Italian prime minister Mario Monti secured only 10.5 per cent of the vote in Italy in 2013 despite the guru 's advice .
