At Tokyo 's Narita Airport , the newly-opened Terminal 3 sure has some quirky features . Among them , strips of brightly-coloured running track , which have been installed in the airport 's hallways . While of course passengers are entertained by the latest buzzworthy stunt , we have to wonder : were they really intended to encourage travellers to dash to their boarding gate ? Tokyo 's Narita Airport has installed running tracks in its new Terminal 3 in honour of the 2020 Olympics . Turns out that the cushioned tracks were actually designed to celebrate the 2020 Olympics , which will be held in Tokyo . But there 's no denying that the footpaths are extremely useful regardless . The blue path leads passengers toward departures , while arrivals can be reached by following the red pathway . Further , in each lane there are a series of icons , which include information such as the distance to other terminals , directions to nearby restaurants and shops and where to find outside transport options . The recently-opened terminal will be primarily used for departures and arrivals of low-cost carriers . To save money , the airport installed these cushioned running tracks , which also include directional information . All of the blue lanes lead towards the departure area , while the red track leads travellers to arrivals . The new terminal , which will be used for many of the city 's low-cost carrier departures , first opened on April 8 and according to the website , the aim of the innovative tracks was , in part , to save money . ` To cut costs , we opted not to install the typical moving walkways or illuminated signs , ' the terminal 's website reads . ` Instead , to offer an exciting walking experience that is easy on the feet , we implemented running tracks used for track and field , and added signage for user-friendly guidance .
