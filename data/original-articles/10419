Remanded : Keith Anthony Allen , 27 , of Columbus pleaded not guilty Monday to charges including rape , felonious assault and gross sexual imposition . He is accused of raping two 12-year-old girls and fondling a third girl . The assault charges allege he raped the girls while knowing he was HIV-positive and had consensual sex with a woman without telling her he has the virus that causes AIDS . Prosecutors say Allen could face a life sentence if he is convicted of having sex with a child under 13 . The case marks the first time that the Franklin County prosecutor 's office has charged an adult with molesting children while knowing that he carries the virus that causes AIDS . ` I was outraged when I saw that police report , ' Franklin County Prosecutor Ron O'Brien told The Columbus Dispatch . O'Brien said Allen had access to the two 12-year-old girls because his girlfriend is related to one of the children and the other sometimes spent the night with them . The assaults took place between September 1 and March 22 , according to the indictment . Allen has been in the Franklin County jail since his arrest on March 25 . His bail was set at $ 1 million . O'Brien says he is unaware of the health status of the victims in this case , whether or not any of them contracted HIV through Allen .
