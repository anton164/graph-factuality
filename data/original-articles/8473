Reading manager Steve Clarke and his players will rally round goalkeeper Adam Federici to help him get over his Wembley gaffe . The Australian blew his side 's chances of beating Arsenal in Saturday 's FA Cup semi-final by spilling Alexis Sanchez 's shot into his own net in extra-time . Federici was inconsolable after the match and Clarke revealed : ` I tried to hug him but he was very , very disappointed . He just wanted to get inside and have his sad moment by himself . You have to respect that . Alexis Sanchez 's low shot squirmed agonisingly through the legs of Adam Federici in extra time . It was a routine shot from Sanchez but the Reading stopper failed to collect it properly in his grasp . The ball rolled through his legs and slowly towards the goal line in the 106th minute of the game . Federici tries desperately to stop the ball going over the line after it rolled through his legs and out of his grasp . ` When he comes into training we 'll have a little chat but he 'll be fine . He 's a professional . ' The incident was reminiscent of Robert Green 's error in England 's 2010 World Cup opener against the USA , when Clint Dempsey 's strike got through him . Reading midfielder Jem Karacan added of Federici : ` He 's one of the best goalkeepers around and they all make mistakes . ` The saves he made earlier were top-class and he was probably man of the match up to that point . Nobody will blame him . ' Federici lies slumped on the ground as the impact of his error hits him in the FA Cup semi-final against Arsenal . The Reading goalkeeper left the field in tears as manager Steve Clarke tries to console him .
