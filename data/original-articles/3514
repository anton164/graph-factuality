The Civil and Administrative tribunal reprimanded Mr Dewar last week and have banned him from re-registering as a psychologist unless he takes part in counselling or further education . The Sydney doctor initially denied any of the events took place during his consultation , telling investigators that he had ` brain confusion ' , however he admitted that he hugged the woman as he liked helping people . He also said he asked the woman for a massage as he had hurt his neck while reversing on the way to her house . Mr Dewar immediately surrendered his registration after the allegations were made , but after a tribunal found him guilty , they said he would have only been suspended for three months .
