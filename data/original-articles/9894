A dog belonging to a Brazilian drugs gang has proved that learning to drop and roll is not just for humans . When police in the southern state of Santa Catarina busted the gang 's lair , the loyal canine laid down alongside its owner and rolled over on its back . The picture showing the line of gang members and their guard dog surrendering to police has since gone viral in Brazil . The incident happened during a joint police and military operation in the neighbourhood of Vargem Grande , in the south Brazilian state of Santa Catarina . Police spokesman Filippo Valdez said : ` The officers had been observing the gang for some time and when they arrested them they recovered a substantial quantity of marijuana and cocaine , as well as weighing scales , guns and ammunition . ` There was a male dog that was barking when officers burst onto the scene but when it saw its owners obeying the command to lie down , it ran over and laid down as well . ' Brazilian animal psychiatrist and dog trainer Barnie Rico said : ` The dog lying on its back exposing its belly is a classic sign of submission in the dog world .

' Online users pointed out that with local police thing to simply shoot dogs on site when carrying out armed raids , it was probably a good move to make sure everyone realised the animal did n't cause any trouble . It was reportedly not arrested with the rest of the suspected gang .
