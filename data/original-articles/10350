Cats and dogs have the advantage over marine pets in that they can interact with humans through the sense of touch . But that does n't prevent one man from dipping his hand in the fish tank and giving his blood parrot cichlid a stroke . Capturing his remarkable relationship on camera , Roland Giroux gently cups the fish with his hand from within side the tank and then treats it to a massage . The fish begins relaxing in the man 's hand and stays very still as the owner begins to stroke it with his finger . The fish initially moves away before swimming in a full circle and returning to rest in between the man 's fingers . The man then begins massaging the pet by running his finger along it and the fish stays completely still as if enjoying the sensation . Repeating the process , the fish swims off once more before immediately returning to the man 's hand to be stroked again . Later in the video the fish interacts further with the man by swimming up his arm and circling his fingers . The man places his hand into the tank and gently cups the blood parrot cichlid with his fingers . Before burying its face into his hand and remaining very still once more . The video concludes with the man removing his hand from the tank and the fish , clearly saddened by this , following it up to the surface of the water . According to Mr Giroux , who uploads many videos of his fish to his Youtube channel , the blood parrot cichlid used to share its tank with two other fish . The fish swims away from the man 's hand a few times in the video but returns to be massaged . But he was forced to remove the other two from the tank when he noticed that they were bullying his prized pet . He then set about interacting with the fish by feeding it frozen blood worms by hand and eventually he noticed it becoming more sociable . After a while the fish enjoyed being stroked and Mr Giroux noted that it would become frustrated if he did n't play with it on a daily basis . The fish begins swimming around the man 's fingers and towards the surface as he removes his hand . The man massages and plays with his fish for at least 15 minutes each day . The blood parrot cichlid is a hybrid of the midas and the redhead cichlid and was first bred in Taiwan around 1986 .
