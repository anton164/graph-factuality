The 90-second attack was captured on CCTV by a neighbour who passed the footage on to the cat 's owner Tracy Lynch , from Tarring , West Sussex , and the police . Ms Lynch , a 44-year-old mother-of-three , had owned the RSPCA rescue cat since 2004 and was devastated after watching the horrific video . ` To find out he had been savaged by the dogs and the owners had not done anything is just completely callous , ' she said . ` That 's what 's most distressing for us that they did n't do anything to check on the cat . ` My youngest son was completely distraught . This is the first family pet he 's lost and he was in floods of tears . ' A police spokesman said the large dogs , which were running loose , were possibly Dobermans and were collected by someone who turned up in a blue car . Left for dead : The 90-second attack was captured on CCTV by a neighbour who passed the footage on to the cat 's owner . Devastating : The disabled cat , called Freeman , was laying in its front garden when the two dogs pounced . The attack took place in Terry Rickards ' front garden as he was away last week . He said : ` It amazes and sickens me that no attempt was made either at the time the dogs were recovered , or at a later stage , to check on the state of the cat . ` As far as I am aware , no attempt has been made since by the dog owners to seek the owners of the cat . It 's a pretty horrific attack really . ' Ms Lynch added : ` He would go around the neighbourhood and everyone knew him . He was a real character . ` I think the neighbours will miss him out and about . '
