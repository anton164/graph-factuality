Bell will miss the first three games for abusing the league 's substance abuse policy and he will also be fined a game cheque . Bell was stopped in his Chevrolet Camaro last August after a police officer noticed a strong smell of marijuana . le ` veon Bell will appeal the NFL 's decision to ban him for the first three games of the season . LeGarrette Blount will miss the first game of the new season after being charged with marijuana possession . Former Steeler LeGarrette Blount and a female passenger were also in the car and the pair were charged with marijuana possession . Bell was also charged with a DUI . Blount - who was waived by Pittsburgh , joined the Patriots in November and went on to win the Super Bowl - was banned for the first game of the season earlier this week . Bell plans to appeal the decision , says ESPN 's Adam Schefter who broke the story . Bell had 2,215 all-purpose yards , 11 touchdowns and made the All-Pro team last season . The Steelers signed veteran running back DeAngelo Williams in free agency and he looks likely to cover for 23-year-old Bell .
