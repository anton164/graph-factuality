A phone thief took a selfie with a handset before stealing a model he preferred - only to be caught when police identified him from the photo . Ivan Balashov was browsing through smartphones in a shop in Novokuznetsk , southern Russia when he took a picture of himself wearing a bobble hat and a fake Reebok top . But after deciding the camera on the mobile was not good enough , the 22-year-old grabbed another handset and headed for the exit where he was stopped by shop security . A shop spokesman said : ` When he was asked where he was going he told the security guard that he wanted to buy the phone - and was going to his car to get his wallet . ` For some reason the guard let him go outside the shop with the phone at which point the man ran off . ' But when police arrived they quickly discovered Balashov 's selfie . A police spokesman said : ` The man is well-known to the police so when the shop assistant told officers he had been taking photos with another phone they immediately recognised him and were able to go straight to the man 's house . ` When they arrived he denied being anywhere near the shop so in a way condemned himself as we were able to prove he had been there just 30 minutes earlier . ' On his way home he had sold the stolen phone in a pawn shop for the equivalent of Â£ 120 . Appearing in court , Balashov was found guilty and given a three month suspended sentence . Police found Balashov 's selfie on a phone in the store and immiediately recognised him . He was found guilty and given a three month suspended sentence -LRB- file picture -RRB- .
