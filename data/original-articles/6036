The LAPD for searching for the person who tagged a police horse with graffiti this week - but the answer may be in the so-called ` art ' . The horse , Charly , was patrolling Venice Beach with his minders on Tuesday when the vandalism incident occurred . It was broad daylight , and somehow the person managed to spray Charlie without the handlers seeing - a move that taggers pride themselves on , but usually with stationary objects and facades . ` I think it 's unfortunate , but people love to tag things in Venice , so really , I guess a horse is just the next step , ' local Mark Stegall told CBS LA . Vandalized : Charly was patrolling Venice Beach with with his minders Tuesday when the cruel tagger managed to write ` RBS ' and an arrow on the horse 's flank with silver spray paint . ` It 's cruel and it 's not respectful , ' another local , Robert Kendall , said . ` It 's bad for the animals and it 's just people who want to mess with the status quo and I think it 's pretty awful . ' However , tags are cryptic signatures , and authorities are hoping they will be able to track down the person responsible using the tag , which was ` RBS ' . A witness who saw the officer taking a picture of Charly after the incident posted their image to Instagram . All clean : The paint came off relatively easily , but police are still trying to find the person responsible . ` RBS ' : The key to finding the tagger likely lies in deciphering the tag , RBS , and working out who it belongs to . A witness who saw the officer taking a picture of Charly after the incident posted their image to Instagram . The paint was cleaned off Charly later on Tuesday night without a problem . However the LAPD has requested the public 's help in identifying the person responsible . Anyone with information was asked to contact detectives at 310-482-6313 . Anyone wishing to remain anonymous can call Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS -LRB- 800-222-8477 -RRB- .
