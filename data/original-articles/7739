Love to all . Best , Joe . ' '' Scroll down for video . The stars of Martin Scorsese 's classic gangster film Goodfellas , Debi Mazar , Paul Sorvino , Robert De Niro , Ray Liotta and Lorraine Branco -LRB- from left to right -RRB- reunited in New York on Saturday night for a very special 25th anniversary screening of the movie which brought the 14th annual Tribeca Film Festival to a close . Released in 1990 , Goodfellas charts the rise and fall of Lucchese crime family associate Henry Hill , played by Liotta , and his friends over a period from 1955 to 1980 . Scorsese and producer Irwin Winkler sent video messages to the audience . ` I remember the previews were one of the worst experiences of my life -- we had three of them and they were all in California . ... It seemed that the audience had to be prepared for what it was , but there was a lot of controversy , ' said the director . He went on to recall how he and screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi were no longer welcome at their favorite Italian restaurant after the movie - and its depiction of Italian-American mobsters - upset the owners . ` Remember that nice Italian restaurant in Tribeca that we used to go to ? And then when the film came out , the owner of the restaurant said we 're not allowed in anymore because we apparently denigrated a certain ethnic group for the picture ? ' said Scorsese . Throughout the two-and-a-half-hour screening the audience cheered each major character 's first appearance along with iconic scenes like Karen Hill 's doorbell-yelling session , and memorable lines like Henry Hill 's opening narration : ` For as long as I can remember , I always wanted to be a gangster . ' Afterwards , Liotta , Bracco , De Niro , Sorvino and Pileggi recalled making the beloved film in a panel discussion moderated by Daily Show host Jon Stewart . Actress Lorriane Bracco appeared in Goodfellas as Henry Hill 's wife Karen before going on to star as Dr. Jennifer Melfi in The Sopranos . Paul Sorvino , right , who starred as mob boss Paul ` Paulie ' Cicero in the movie , revealed during the q & a that he had come close to quitting just days before filming as he failed to find the character . In the absense of Pesci , it was left to Liotta , who played mob informant Henry Hill , to recall how his co-star 's famous ` Do I Amuse You ' sequence was almost entirely improvised . ` Joe was just telling a story in rehearsal about something that happened to him in Queens , ' said Liotta . ` Some guy , who happened to be a connected guy , said , `` You think that 's funny ? '' The scene helped snag Pesci his Best Supporting Actor Oscar . Liotta also recalled a bowling alley meeting with Hill , who told the actor he loved the movie . ` The first thing he said was thanks for not making me look like a s *** bag , ' said Liotta . ` I said , `` Did you see the movie ? '' Sorvino , who starred as mob boss Paul ` Paulie ' Cicero , then revealed that he had come close to quitting just days before filming . ` I was really lost , what do you do , I called my agent up and said , `` Get me out ! , '' said the actor , who told the audiance that he is a ` soft guy ' and nothing like his character . No show : Joe Pesci , who won an Oscar for his turn as Tommy DeVito , did n't show for the 25th year anniversary but sent an email which read ` F *** , f *** , f *** , f *** ity f *** , f *** ' , said De Niro . Twenty five years on : Ray Liotta and Lorriane Bracco starred as husband and wife Henry and Karen Hill in Martin Scorsese 's gangster epic Goodfellas , left , and shared a drink at Saturday 's reunion , right . Robert De Niro , who founded the Tribeca Film Festival , arrived at Saturday 's screening with his wife Grace Hightower . ` Then I was going to fix my tie and I saw this guy -LRB- in the mirror -RRB- , ' he added , flashing a cold stare . ` And it scared the hell out of me . That 's the guy ! ' Also in attendance were several actors who had minor roles in the movie including Kevin Corrigan and Debi Mazar , who played Sandy , a friend of Henry Hill 's mistress . Earlier on the red carpet , Liotta had recalled something Scorsese told him before filming began that made him believe he was going to be part of something special . ` He said , ` I want to shoot this like a gangster , '' said Liotta . '' ` If I want to freeze frame , if I want to voice over , if I want to whatever ... '' And that 's what he did . It gave him a lot liberty to just be him . ' That mindset paid off . Many regard the Oscar-nominated mob tale as more than just a great film of the genre , but also one of the greatest movies of all time . Scorsese used a compelling narrative with strong visuals married by a powerful rock soundtrack to reinvent the gangster film . ` I do n't know if he reinvented it as much as he just created his own version of it , ' Liotta said . Sorvino , who portrayed Paulie the mob capo that takes Liotta 's Henry under his wing , thinks Scorsese went beyond reinventing the genre . ` It 's not even part of a genre ; it 's like tearing off that wall and taking a look inside to see what it really is , ' Sorvino said of the gritty depiction of life as a mid-level mobster . Jon Stewart , far right , hosted a q & a with the film 's star during which Ray Liotta , far left , recalled meeting the real Henry Hill , who thanked him for ` not making me look like a s *** bag ' In attendance at Saturday 's screening of Goodfellas were actors Paul Sorvino , Debi Mazar , Robert De Niro , Lorraine Bracco and Kevin Corrigan -LRB- from left to right -RRB- . The 76-year-old actor expressed gratitude to have a part in the film . ` It 's part of the iconography of American film , ' Sorvino said . ` It 's one of the three or four greatest movies ever made , and if you get to do that in your career , you 're pretty lucky . ' Based on the nonfiction best-seller Wiseguy written by Nicholas Pileggi , the story traces the life of Henry Hill -- a mobster-turned-informant -- from his childhood and life of petty crime to rise and fall in the underworld . The film also stars De Niro as James ` Jimmy The Gent ' Conway . De Niro is one of the film festival 's co-creators . ` The fact that he helped put it together right after 9/11 and bring Tribeca back as well as New York -- that was just honorable in itself . And to sustain it for so long now , it represents a great thing in movies , that 's great for movies , and a great thing for the city , ' Liotta said . De Niro , Jane Rosenthal and Craig Hatkoff founded the Tribeca Film Festival in 2002 as a means of stimulating the lower Manhattan neighborhood after the Sepember 11 attacks . But Lorraine Bracco , who played Henry 's wife , Karen , thinks the festival did more than revitalize the city . ` It 's for the world to see that we 're still standing strong , ' Bracco said . Saturday 's screening of Goodfellas , staring Ray Liotta , marked the end of the 14th annual Tribeca Film Festival .
