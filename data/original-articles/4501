Thousands of holidaymakers caught up in last summer 's passport delay fiasco have not received any compensation . At the same time , managers at the passport agency , which made a £ 42 million profit during the chaos , received up to £ 3,500 in bonuses . Ministers refused to give a blanket refund to the desperate families who had to pay extra to get their travel documents rushed through , and even to some who missed out on trips . Scroll down for video . The boxes of passport applications piled up at in office in Liverpool at the peak of the backlog last summer . Keith Vaz , who as chairman of the Home Affairs Committee led the calls for compensation , said last night : ` I am astonished so few people have been given compensation for what was a fiasco presided over by the management of the passport office , especially as they made a profit last year that ran into millions of pounds . ' The problems began a year ago as HM Passport Office struggled to cope with 3.6 million Britons applying for documents . By mid-June there were more than half a million passports stuck in the system . Ministers agreed to give urgent cases a free upgrade to the fast-track service , but thousands had already paid the extra £ 30 per passport for this . Many still missed trips because their passports did not arrive in time . Details obtained by The Mail on Sunday show scarcely any of the thousands of holidaymakers caught up in the chaos ever got anything back from the Passport Office . In total just 2,191 compensation applications were approved between April last year and January this year , scarcely changed from 2,077 for the previous year . The total paid out was £ 203,066 , giving an average sum of £ 92.68 . The biggest single payout was £ 5,463 ; the lowest £ 1 . The Passport Office said it could not say how many claims were rejected , partly because of ` the system failure of our customer complaint database ' . It can be revealed however that Ministers rejected a demand by the Home Affairs Select Committee for all those left out of pocket to be compensated , saying : ` It would create a precedent . ' Home Affairs Committee chairman Keith Vaz led the calls for compensation and was ` astonished ' to learn just 2,191 compensation applications were approved . This newspaper contacted more than a dozen holidaymakers who had either missed trips or had to pay extra to get passports in time . Only one had got money back . Among those refused were Mathew Bean and Hayley Kirkham . They lost close to £ 1,500 on a trip to Morocco , where he had planned to propose , because their passports did not arrive in time -- even though they had applied ten weeks before they were due to travel and paid for upgrades . HM Passport Office made a surplus of £ 42.3 million between April and October last year . In 2013-14 , the most recent figures available , managers were handed a total of £ 1.8 million in bonuses , with the average reward £ 499 and the highest £ 3,500 .
