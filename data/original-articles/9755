The French rugby federation is looking for candidates to replace France coach Philippe Saint-Andre following the World Cup . Since taking over from Marc Lievremont , who led France to the World Cup final in 2011 , Saint-Andre has failed to impose himself , winning only 15 of his 37 games in charge . He has overseen poor results in the Six Nations , finishing no higher than fourth and even last in 2013 . Philippe Saint-Andre -LRB- right -RRB- arrives for training in Marcoussis with Louis Picamoles -LRB- left -RRB- and Nicolas Mas . Saint-Andre has struggled as head coach of Les Bleus winning just 15 of his 37 games in charge . Saint-Andre will remain in charge for the World Cup in England from September 18 to October 31 . The FFR launched the application process to find his replacement on Friday , with candidates having until April 25 to declare their bid . Among the favorites to land the job are Begles-Bordeaux coach Rapahael Ibanez , former Montpellier manager Fabien Galthie and long-time Toulouse coach Guy Noves . Saint-Andre succeeded Marc Lievremont -LRB- above -RRB- following the 2011 World Cup in New Zealand .
