A French bus driver has proposed putting on a separate service for Roma passengers - because the ` unbearable ' smell is a health risk to everyone on board . Dominique Granier sparked outrage after he suggested putting on a service specifically for people travelling from a Roma encampment next to a cemetery into the centre of Montpellier , in the south of France . But while his comments were immediately met with horror by some , the bus company TAM has taken his comments seriously and is said to have ` outsourced ' part of the route . Odour : The smell on route 9 in Montpellier is said to be ` unbearable ' and caused by Roma using the service . Bus driver Mr Granier said the smell which accompanied the Roma was a ` sanitation risk ' in an interview last week . Speaking to the Gazette de Montpelier Mr Granier said : ` It is a true infection . ' His claims were backed up by other drivers , one of whom claimed the buses were now specially cleaned because of the odour . Bernard Gotis , a local union representative , was disgusted by the comments . ` We should not tackle the poor , but poverty ... We do not want to recreate apartheid in Montpellier , ' he said . Apartheid : Some have said the problem is poverty of those living in the camp . Pictured : Roma in Montpellier . However , Mr Gotis revealed the bus company had taken on the suggestion , and apparently outsourced part of the route so drivers no longer had to contend with the smell . He told French newspaper Lib√©ration : ` Our management decided to follow the union by removing a piece of this bus line which is very popular with Roma and to outsource this portion of line . ' The MailOnline has contacted Montpellier 's bus service for a comment .
