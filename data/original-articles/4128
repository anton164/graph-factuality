Blackpool chairman Karl Oyston took a surprising step in denying five Football Association charges for text messages during which he labelled a supporter a ` retard ' . The unpopular chief initially had until March 30 to reply , but was granted an extension . His appeal is expected to be heard by a separate FA panel next month and Oyston still faces a ban from football activities . Blackpool chairman Karl Oyston has decided to contest his FA charge for allegedly abusive text messages . Oyston - who has been the constant target of fan protests over the course of the Seasiders ' worst season for decades - is also looking at a hefty fine and mandatory four-hour FA education course . The shocking text messages , seen by Sportsmail , emerged just before Christmas when he sent a series of vitriolic volleys to fan Stephen Smith , who he told to ` enjoy the rest of your special needs day out ' . Oyston later apologised for his part in the exchange , and it is understood his denial boils down to a reasonable expectation of privacy . The development comes just days after pensioner Frank Knight , a lifelong fan , was ordered to pay £ 20,000 in damages for alleged defamatory remarks made on his Facebook page . The footballing world rallied around Knight , with a kickstarter fund amassing the thousands he needed to pay . On announcing Oyston 's denial , an FA statement read : ` It is alleged that the misconduct constituted five breaches of FA rules , and that during the text message exchange , Mr Oyston used abusive and/or insulting words towards a supporter of Blackpool FC . ` It is further alleged that each of these five breaches of FA Rule E3 -LRB- 1 -RRB- is an ` Aggravated Breach ' as defined in Rule E3 -LRB- 2 -RRB- , as each included a reference to disability . ` Mr Oyston has denied the charge . ' It is not the only example of foul-mouthed exchanges to have happened in a bitter campaign . The Oystons are extremely unpopular at the club , and fans have been protesting against their ownership . In a another rant from Oyston , who also had abuse hurled at him , said : ` Stop texting f ****** , you should n't have ever started as you are one tiresome f ***** that should spot trains not watch football . Get a life and consider yourself banned from the stadium . ` You are banned because I think you are a p **** . ` Impossible to have a meaningful conversation with such a f ******* as you . ' Oyston also joked with other fans that plans are afoot to see Blackpool , a Premier League side four years ago , spiral down to the Conference , with another text reading : ` I am a never-ending nightmare revenge mission ' . Their relegation to League One was confirmed early last week and they are on course to tally the lowest number of points ever in the modern day second tier . There is to be a mass demonstration against their despised reign prior to the final game of the season against Huddersfield next Saturday . The content of the vile messages first emerged just before Christmas and Oyston came in for widespread condemnation . Anti-discrimination group Kick It Out registered their disgust , with local paper the Blackpool Gazette scrapping the chairman 's weekly column with immediate effect . Supporters have been protesting against the Oystons before matches and then not attending the games . Blackpool 's off-field problems have become such a distraction that the club posted an article on their official site clarifying their stance on ongoing defamation cases , one involving a national newspaper . Their lengthy statement on Tuesday read : ` Reluctantly , the company has been compelled to take action against a number of individuals and organisations following online postings or articles that contained vile lies and abuse about the club , its directors and players . To date , three settlements have been agreed with several further cases pending against other individuals and a national newspaper . ` Any payments from court or agreed settlements will be anonymously distributed to Fylde and North West based charities . The rationale of this policy is to avoid the adverse reaction towards such charities that accept the donations , as was the case when the club donated the first settlement to a leading , vibrant and forward thinking charity in Blackpool , Fylde and Wyre . ` The latest settlement of £ 20,000 will be paid over four years in equal installments , with the charities set to benefit as and when the money is received by the club . ` For the avoidance of doubt , the club , directors , management staff and players would far prefer not to take any defamation action against any individual or organisation , but must continue to take action where necessary to combat the false , misleading stories and lies that are being perpetuated .
