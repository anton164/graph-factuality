This is the shocking moment a worker risked his life by standing on top of a house jet washing a roof with what appears to be just a rope tied around him for safety . The unnamed worker was spotted on the roof 30-feet above the ground on top of an Edwardian semi-detached home in Greenwich , south east London . A local resident noticed the man carrying out the work with a lack of safety equipment on the slippery tiles and quickly took snaps of the man . A worker who was caught jet washing the roof of a home in south east London with just a rope tied around him for safety . The neighbour said : ` I could n't believe it . He was standing on the roof with a power washer and seemed to have a rope tied around his waist . ` It looked incredibly dangerous . His boss seemed to be watching sitting on a wall opposite and seemed unfazed by it all . ' A building expert , who did not want to be named , said the workman should have at least had scaffolding up at the front of the property and a much longer ladder with a harness . He said : ` You ca n't just stand up there with a bit of rope tied around you and think it 's fine , it 's not . ` You have to think about how slippery it would be up there because as you can see he is spraying from the top to bottom , meaning the water will be trickling down around his feet . A building expert said the man should have at least had scaffolding up at the front of the property and a longer ladder . ` You would only have to slip and fall once and that would be it . ' The image was then passed to the Health and Safety Executive , who attended the property and caught the man doing the same thing on the roof of the garage before he was stopped . A HSE Spokeswoman said : ` Following a concern raised , HSE inspectors visited the house yesterday and served a prohibition notice . ` This means the work had to cease until appropriate safety measures are put in place .
