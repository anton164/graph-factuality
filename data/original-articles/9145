Jimmy Anderson has been motivated to play 100 Tests for England by the bitter memories of being marginalised in the early stages of his outstanding career . Anderson makes his landmark appearance here in Antigua on Monday needing just four wickets to overtake Sir Ian Botham and become the leading Test wicket-taker in England 's history . And the Lancastrian will do it remembering the times when it seemed he would become no more than a county bowler . Jimmy Anderson takes part in an England practice session on Saturday ahead of his 100th Test on Monday . Anderson and the England players are put through their paces as they sprint up a hill . ` I 've never forgotten the sitting on the sidelines for 18 months or two years and not being able to be out there doing what I love , ' said Anderson . ` Obviously I was playing county cricket , which was great , but the ultimate is playing for England and I want to do that for as long as possible . ` I got off to a good start to my career but then had a few years out of the England side with dodgy form and injuries . I did n't know if I 'd ever play again . ` Those were the low periods but I had experienced Test cricket and seen how amazing it was and that determination to play again has driven me on . Once I got my chance again -- I think it was 2007 or 2008 -- I did n't want to let it go again . ' Anderson celebrates after taking a wicket during the warm-up match against St Kitts & Nevis earlier this week . Anderson says he wants to continue playing Test cricket for as long as possible . Anderson , fit at 32 , wants to carry on for as long as possible , including in one-day cricket even though he accepts he could be dropped from the 50-over team as England rebuild after their disastrous World Cup . ` My body , touch wood , has never been better , ' he said . ` I have consciously worked on it the last few years . Once you get past 30 things get hard but I feel good and I feel as though I could go on for a few more years . '
