NHS finances are so dire that patients could soon be forced to pay to use basic services such as GPs , doctors leaders warned last night . Dr Mark Porter , head of the British Medical Association , the doctors ' union , said that whoever wins the election will inevitably be tempted to bring in charges . All three major parties have denied there will be any end to the principle that the NHS should be free at the point of use . Dr Mark Porter , head of the British Medical Association , the doctors ' union , said that whoever wins the election will inevitably be tempted to bring in charges . Critics will say that if GPs had not enjoyed such enormous pay rises over the past decade , there would be much more money around . In an interview with the Guardian , Dr Porter said of the parties fighting the election : ` I think they will be tempted . They said in 1950 that a Labour government would n't introduce charging and it did . ' The introduction of prescription charges prompted NHS founder Nye Bevan to resign from Clement Attlee 's government in April 1951 . Dr Porter said it was ` inescapable ' that the next government would consider introducing fees as a way of tackling the £ 30billion budget gap that NHS England has forecast will open by 2020 unless it achieves its target of £ 22billion in efficiency savings and receives £ 8billion of extra annual funding . He said : ` Could a future government be tempted ? Yes , they could , but they must resist that temptation . ' Critics will say that if GPs had not enjoyed such enormous pay rises over the past decade , there would be much more money around .
