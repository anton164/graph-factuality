Chelsea midfielder Oscar hopes that winning the Premier League title this season can kick-start a period of dominance in English football for the Blues . Jose Mourinho 's side are 10 points clear of second-placed Arsenal , who they play at the weekend , and Brazil international Oscar has aspirations of further success in the coming seasons . ` Hopefully , yes . This squad is really young and we 've been playing together for a long time , ' he told Goal . ` We are improving as the time goes by . This is good for the players and for the club . We know each others ' movements on the pitch . Oscar -LRB- right -RRB- hopes that Chelsea winning the Premier League can kick-start a period of dominance in England . The Blues have already won the Capital One Cup this season and are close to securing the league title . ` We know we are very close to the title but there are some challenges ahead , ' he added . ` If we manage to lift this trophy and keep this level of performance we certainly will do some other good seasons like this one . ' Chelsea travel to the Emirates on Sunday to face their nearest rivals Arsenal , and a win can take them 13 points clear at the top of the Premier League . Arsenal , though , have won eight matches in a row in the league and will certainly not go down without a fight . This is something Oscar , and his Chelsea team-mates , are well aware of . ` Arsenal have improved a lot , ' the 23-year-old continued . ` They have won almost every match they played recently . So we know they are a real threat . The good thing is we 've been doing well and we know that we are up to any challenge .
