Charanjeet Kondal has used an application to create images of the new prince or princess . The software programmer said : ` I focus on all of the facial features of both of the parents and Morph Thing comes up with an average . ` Everything is taken to consideration - eyes , nose , jawline , and hairline - to come up with a clear picture . ` The software can be used by anyone by just putting two faces together . ' The betting public believe the latest addition to the royal family will arrive on Wednesday - the couple 's fourth wedding anniversary - or Thursday next week with odds of 4/1 . It remains odds-on at 8/15 for a girl , however the eleventh hour support for a boy is in full swing at 11/8 .
