If there 's one thing that stops a boiled egg from being the perfect food - it 's the hassle of peeling it . More often than not the process will leave you with fragments of shell in your fingers , on the kitchen counter and sometimes even in your food . But one canny YouTube user , MicahMedia , has uploaded a video demonstrating the simplest and swiftest way to peel a hardboiled egg - using a glass of water . Scroll down for video . The hard-boiled egg is placed in a glass -LRB- left -RRB- before it is filled quarter of the way with tap water -LRB- right -RRB- . He pops the hardboiled egg into a small tumbler glass before filling it a quarter of the way with water . He then places his hand over the top of the glass , completely covering it . His next move is to vigorously shake the glass from left to right . He keeps the glass in the sink so that the water does n't spill . After approximately ten seconds of shaking , the YouTuber lifts his hand to show the egg , which now has a cracked shell . He simply puts his hand in the glass and in a matter of miliseconds , lifts up the shell of the egg which has been loosened from the egg . The 28-second video which was uploaded in January this year currently has over 16million views on the video-sharing website . The egg is vigorously shaken from left to right so that the shell loosens . Result ! Once the water has splashed out of the glass , simply peel lift the shell from the egg with no hassle . YouTube users have been praising MicahMedia for his ingenious solution to the age-old problem . ` Well this has changed my morning . Good job , thanks , ' wrote Nikki Madison . Susan Wheeler wrote : ` I have tried just about every method I have come across and been disappointed on the most part . This actually works wonderfully . I love doing it . Thanks ! ' MicahMedia posted that he 's thinking of ` doing six boiled eggs at once and seeing what happens . '
