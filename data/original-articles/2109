Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall lauded his young guns after their latest European heartache before declaring he has no intention of overspending in a competitive post-World Cup transfer market . McCall watched his side , which contained five English-qualified forwards in the starting pack , battle in vain before losing 13-9 to the Clermont on Saturday . Saracens ' millionaire chairman Nigel Wray spent much of last week repeating his belief the cap should be scrapped in order for Saracens to compete at Europe 's top table , raising expectations they could be set to land a ` marquee ' player from outside the league whose wages would sit outside next season 's Â£ 5.5 m cap . Maro Itoje -LRB- second left -RRB- was one of five England-qualified forwards in the Saracens pack that faced Clermont .

But McCall said : ` We know where we 'd like to improve our side and we 're prepared to wait for the right person . We do n't want to jump in and get `` a name '' just because he 's available post-World Cup . ` The fact our pack is as young as it is is incredibly exciting for us . They could be the mainstay of the club for the next four to five seasons . ' Billy Vunipola -LRB- left -RRB- , Jim Hamilton and Itoje leave the field following their 13-9 loss against Clermont .
