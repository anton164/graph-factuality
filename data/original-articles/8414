It could be the result of jetlag , or maybe a few too many beers . As passengers waited to collect their luggage from the baggage reclaim , they were in for a shock when they discovered a man asleep on the conveyor . The incredible footage was shot at Domodedovo Airport in Russia , and shows a man lying in the foetal position seemingly away with the fairies . A man decided to have a snooze on the airport baggage reclaim , not looking too comfortable . While the rubber may well be more comfortable than the airport floor , the swinging motion of the conveyor make it a less-than comfortable snooze . Incredibly , other passengers appear more concerned with spotting their luggage than the fate of the dozing man in shorts . It 's not the first instance where passengers have decided to relax on the baggage reclaim . An inebriated Chinese passenger wandered into a train station in his home country and fell asleep on the luggage belt . While some passengers appeared amused by the sleeping man , most were focused on claiming their luggage . When the machine started working , the man was taken through the X-ray scanner . Officials at the station decided to release the images as a warning to others not to do similar . And staff at Rome 's Fiumicino Airport spotted a man curled up on the conveyor after a 55-yard free ride . The Norwegian was believed to be under the influence of alcohol , and had clambered over a check-in desk to grab some rest . The incident brought smiles from those waiting for luggage , while the passenger circled around .
