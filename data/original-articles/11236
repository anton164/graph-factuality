Jose Mourinho has thickened up his Chelsea midfield for Sunday 's west London derby at QPR . The Chelsea manager has been trialling a formation with Ramires and Nemanja Matic in front of the back four as the league leaders head to Loftus Road . Mourinho has stuck with the team that it is likely to mean a more advanced role for Cesc Fabregas in the ` No10 ' position behind Didier Drogba up front , with fellow striker Loic Remy out injured . Brazilian midfielder Oscar has failed to complete 90 minutes in any of Chelsea 's last 11 games . Eden Hazard , who Mourinho believes is the only realistic candidate to be named PFA player of the year , starts on the left . Willian will start on the right and his Brazilian team-mate Oscar may drop out of the starting line up for the clash at QPR . Chelsea are four points clear of Arsenal with two games in hand and Mourinho does not want to take any chances at Loftus Road . Chelsea 's Nemanja Matic -LRB- right -RRB- , in action against Stoke , is set to feature again in the heart of midfield . Oscar was disappointing during last weekend 's win , and Mourinho hit out at his performance afterwards . Ramires -LRB- left -RRB- is set to be restored to the Chelsea midfield for west London at QPR on Sunday . Oscar has n't scored for Chelsea since the middle of January after an alarming dip in form for the Blues .
