James Collins can rest easy . As sensational an own goal as his inadvertently precise lob over Adrian was in West Ham 's 2-0 defeat at Manchester City , it was not the weekend 's most bizarre . Not by a long way . That honour falls to Mohammad Shatnawi of Jordanian club Al Faisaly , whose effort will be considered as one of the strangest own goals ever . His team were 1-0 down against Al Whidat in the Amman Derby when their opponents pushed forward , looking to double their lead . VIDEO - Scroll down to see Mohammad Shatnawi 's amazing own goal . Mohammed Shatnawi bizarrely scored an own goal by kicking the ball over his head at the weekend . Shatnawi appeared to be trying to put the ball out of play after initially making a good save . He watches on in horror as the ball floats ominously towards the net after his overhead kick . As the Al Whidat striker closed in on goal and lashed a venomous strike on target , Shatnawi got down well to stop it with his foot , an impulsive reaction block . But what happened next , as the ball looped up in the air , is inexplicable . Perhaps Shatnawi did not realise he had as much time as he did to collect the rebound . Maybe he thought what he was about to do was the best way to eliminate any impending danger . Or maybe he even mistook his team-mates for opponents . West Ham 's James Collins -LRB- right -RRB- accidentally lobbed his goalkeeper trying to clear a cross on Sunday . Shatnawi kept his eyes on the ball , leaned back , raised his right leg and kicked it over his head , one would imagine in an unorthodox attempt to send the ball over his goal and out for a corner . Instead , his touch was a little too cushioned , and the ball drifted nonchalantly into his own net .
