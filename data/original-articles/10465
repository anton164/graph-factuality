Sunshine smile : Judy Murray waves to the crowds . Her youngest son has only just tied the knot with his long-term partner Kim Sears . But Judy Murray has already wasted no time in revealing she simply ` ca n't wait to be a granny ' . However , the tennis coach , who helped propel Andy , 27 , and his brother , Jamie , 29 , to sporting success , has a couple of caveats -- he has to get the French Open and Wimbledon out of the way first . Mrs Murray , 55 , who has carved out her own star status after appearing on Strictly Come Dancing last year , also said she would be a ` very active granny ' and in the same way she coached her sons , she already has plans to introduce her grandchildren to tennis . She told Closer magazine : ` I 'm really looking forward to being a granny . I 've always wanted to have grandchildren but I had to be patient and let them get married first . ` I 'm not sure when they will have kids as Andy has the French Open followed by Wimbledon , but I know he wants them . I will be a very active granny , that 's for sure -- and I ca n't wait to introduce them to tennis . ' Her words come only a few days after her son and his bride wed at Dunblane Cathedral on Saturday , drawing more than 3,000 well-wishers to the streets of his home town . Writing in the guest book of Cromlix House Hotel -- a property Murray purchased in 2013 for Â£ 1.8 million and where his brother got married -- the happy couple thanked staff for their hard work around the top-secret event and signed as ` Andy & Kimberly Murray ' . The new Mrs Murray , who wore a flowing Jenny Packham gown , wrote : ` Thank you to Graeme and every single one of you at Cromlix who worked so hard to make this weekend the best of our lives -- a special place filled with very special people ! X. ' The couple were among a handful of people who wrote in the public guest book at the hotel , which reopened to the public yesterday .
