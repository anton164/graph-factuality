Juventus goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon has no immediate plans to retire and said it would be a waste to quit now when he feels he is still in top form . ` A player stops when he feels that he is no longer what he was before on the pitch , ' Buffon , 37 , told reporters after Juventus beat Monaco 1-0 in the Champions League on Tuesday . ` Looking at it objectively , that is not my case . I will continue to keep playing as long as I am doing well , otherwise it would be a waste . Why bid farewell to football if you are playing well ? ' Juventus goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon says he is not thinking about retiring because he is still playing well . The Italy international produced a solid display to stop Monaco from scoring an away goal on Tuesday night . The Juventus captain celebrates after his side recorded a 1-0 win in the first leg of the quarter-final . ` At the first sign of slipping , I would be the first to bow out . I think one should stop playing when goes onto the field and you see that you are no longer the same person , ' he added . Buffon , who has helped Juventus win three successive Serie A titles and is still Italy 's first-choice goalkeeper , made three important saves to deny Monaco an away goal in Tuesday 's game . Buffon joined Juventus from Parma in 2001 , and stayed with them even after they were demoted to Serie B following the Calciopoli match-fixing scandal in 2006 , the same year he helped Italy win the World Cup .
