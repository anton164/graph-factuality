Troubling questions : Lord Janner controversially escaped prosecution for a string of child abuse allegations because the Crown Prosecution Service said Alzheimer 's has left him unfit to face trial . A former Director of Public Prosecutions has said lawyers involved in the decision not to charge Lord Janner with child abuse in 2007 failed to pass new evidence to him . Lord Macdonald QC , who was DPP between 2003 and 2008 , said that instead of consulting with headquarters in London , CPS lawyers in Leicestershire decided fresh evidence against Janner was not worth pursuing through the courts . That decision meant Janner , now 86 , was able to escape prosecution for eight years until the CPS controversially announced earlier this week that he is now unfit to stand trial due to Alzheimer 's . Speaking to The Guardian , Lord Macdonald said : ` It is a matter of great regret that I was never informed of the existence of this case in 2007 . ` If it had been referred to me , I would certainly have given it my close and robust personal attention . ` The grave failure on the part of the local CPS lawyers to refer this case to headquarters is no doubt one of the matters that -LRB- High Court judge -RRB- Sir Richard Henriques will be looking at in his review of these cases . ' Alison Millar , head of the abuse team at law firm Leigh Day , who represented an alleged victim of Lord Janner , said : ` The main option now for those who allege they were abused by Lord Janner , to ensure their claims are investigated and for their voice to be heard , is through a civil legal claim . ` We are currently investigating the feasibility of such a legal challenge . ' The news comes after it was revealed last night that Westminster attendance records show Janner attended the House of Lords almost daily and claimed more than £ 100,000 in expenses in the four years after he was diagnosed with the disease . He only stopped attending Parliament -- and claiming up to £ 300 a day for doing so -- when child abuse police raided his house on December 2013 . Even in that month he attended the Lords 12 times . Lord Janner is said by his alleged victims to have preyed on young boys at care homes near his Leicester West constituency . On Thursday Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said the peer would not be prosecuted because his condition means there could be no criminal conviction . She said there was evidence to charge Janner with 22 sexual offences against children carried out between 1969 and 1988 , and that he should have been prosecuted in 1991 , when Janner 's name was raised in a major paedophile trial , and again in 2007 . Lord Macdonald QC , Director of Public Prosecutions from 2003 to 2008 , said the decision not to prosecute Janner in 2007 was made by local CPS lawyers , and new evidence was not passed to him . Probes : Greville Janner , left in 1974 , served as an MP for decades and was investigated in 1991 , 2002 and 2007 . She went on to say that ` mistakes were made ' , and commissioned retired High Court judge , Sir Richard Henriques , to launch an inquiry . But her ruling means nine alleged victims will never have the chance to have their claims tested in court . And analysis of records shows Janner continued speaking fluently for years after his diagnosis and was also alert enough to claim expenses among the highest in the Lords . In the 12 months up to April 2009 , the year of his diagnosis , he attended the Lords 143 times -- only just shy of the 147 maximum possible . And he managed to fill in forms procuring himself £ 12,075 in subsistence payments and £ 13,468 in ` office costs ' -- with another £ 691 in mileage claims for his car . In the following year , up to April 2010 , he attended 136 days at the Lords out of a maximum 142 and claimed £ 10,986 subsistence , £ 11,625 office costs and £ 589 mileage . In the year to April 2011 he turned up 126 days out of 137 , and claimed expenses totalling £ 34,014 . In the year to April 2012 , Janner attended 143 days out of a maximum of 156 . He also managed to claim a hefty £ 28,800 in expenses . In the following year , up to April 2013 , he turned up 136 days out of 144 , and claimed expenses totalling £ 24,600 . In April , May and June 2013 he attended every one of the 30 days the Lords sat , claiming a total of £ 6,450 in expenses . In July he was absent just one out of 20 days , claiming £ 2,850 for the remaining 19 . Pointing : Channel 4 News filmed Lord Jenner outside his house in London on July 8 2014 , in what was is the most recent moving image of the Labour peer . And in August , September , October and November , he did not miss a single sitting out of 32 days , and claimed £ 4,800 in expenses . Yesterday David Cameron said : ` I have enormous sympathy for anyone who has been the victim of crime or sexual abuse . ` But it is a very important principle that decisions about prosecutions are taken by independent authorities and we have to be very careful not to step over the line , however frustrating it may sometimes feel that people are n't getting the justice that they deserve . ' Claims that Janner was not fit to stand trial have been undermined by another case where a sex offender with dementia was brought to court . David Massingham , 77 , was deemed not fit to stand trial on historic child abuse allegations because of his mental health but he was charged with 12 offences . He denied molesting two boys more than 30 years ago . A finding of fact hearing was held before a jury at Teesside Crown Court in February last year . The jury decided Massingham , of Middlesbrough , had committed the acts . He was not found to be guilty , or not guilty , but a judge ordered he be detained indefinitely in hospital . Peter Saunders , of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood , said the case proved what the authorities could have done over Janner . He said : ` At the very least for the sake of victim survivors they should get that opportunity , to tell their truth before that kind of trial . ' A procedure exists to deal with criminal suspects thought to have mental illness . In serious cases where a judge rules a suspect is not fit to stand trial a jury can hear the evidence in the suspect 's absence and decide if the individual committed the crimes .
