Wilshere watched Arsenal beat Liverpool 4-1 in the Premier League from the stands on Saturday afternoon . Wilshere has been out of action since November after breaking his foot against Manchester United , as has club captain Arteta who picked up an ankle injury at home to Borussia Dortmund . Diaby 's fitness troubles have been well documented , with the French midfielder racking up 227 weeks out during his nine-year career with the club . All three featured in last week 's practice match against a Brentford development XI , with England international Wilshere scoring in the 4-0 victory . Mathieu Debuchy and Mathieu Flamini also appeared in that game , though both are now closer to first team action with the latter coming on against Liverpool on Saturday . Arsene Wenger said last Thursday : ` They 've no problem after that coming out of the game . They are back available in training , a bit short still of top competitive level certainly but that 's normal . ` They 've been out for a long time but I was quite surprised by how fit they looked and the quality of their performance - it was good . ' Abou Diaby has been blighted by injuries for the best part of a decade but played last week in a friendly . England star Wilshere scored the opening goal and created another against a Brentford development XI .
