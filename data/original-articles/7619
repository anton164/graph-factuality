The Queen and Princess Margaret recorded a special tape of favourite children 's songs for the Queen Mother 's 90th birthday in August 1990 . Pianist Laurie Holloway was invited to Buckingham Palace by Princess Margaret to accompany herself and The Queen for the performance which was recorded on a cassette tape . The Royals recorded songs such as I know Where The Flies Go In Winter Time , which were incredibly popular when the Queen and her sister were growing up . The Queen was 64 at the time and Margaret 59 . The Queen , left , and Princess Margaret , right made the recording for the Queen Mother , centre , in 1990 . The Queen Mother , centre right , was said to be delighted by the unique recording by her daughters . Mr Holloway told The Mirror that he arrived at the Palace and was shown into a room containing a piano and two microphones . He said : ` There was a sound engineer . We recorded each song in one take . The Queen has a nice , sweet tone to her voice . ' Princess Margaret told Mr Holloway that the Queen Mother really liked the tape - although she had to go into her car to listen to it as she did not own a cassette player . Unfortunately , the unique recording was lost following the Queen Mother 's death in 2002 at the age of 101 . Meanwhile , it has emerged that the Queen Mother enjoyed a drink of gin at 11 am according to a new biography of her favourite servant Billy Tallon . The Queen Mother enjoyed dancing with Mr Tallon , who she referred to as William . She preferred the music of the 1920s . He was responsible for delivering The Queen Mother her first drink of the day and if it was n't strong enough she would remark : ' ` William , do remember that when it comes to gin I have my reputation to consider . ' Pianist Laurie Holloway , pictured , was asked to accompany the Queen by Princess Margaret .
