I still ca n't feel any of my cheek , no feeling has come back . I could n't sleep on that side of my face and they did n't know if I 'd lose my eye . I have double vision as a result and a facial wound . ` It has got me down . I was hiding my face when I went out and do n't like pictures so I always turn to my left . I felt like I looked horrible and was walking around with a scarf pulled up . People were saying , `` look at her eye , look at her face '' and were pointing at me on the bus . ` I 've been told my eye could drop and there could still be long term damage . ` I just remember pulling my phone out of my pocket to look at a text and the next thing I felt a blow to my face and stumbling back . I thought someone had punched me but my head was pulsing that much . Miss Hughes , who does n't drink because of acid reflux condition had blood pouring down her face before she was taken by ambulance to hospital . ` I felt like I 'd lost half of my face . There was instant swelling and blood was coming down my face . There was just no rhyme or reason to it .

Prosecutor Karen Brooks told the court : ` It involves jumping around and punching towards each other . Miss Hughes had been to such venues before and knew what to expect and her and her friends stood back . ` Whilst she was sending a text message the defendant picked up a pint glass from the floor , placed it on a table then picked it up and threw it across the dance floor . It hit the complainant on the side of her head which she was n't expecting , her face was bleeding and swelling . ' The court was told that there had been a crowd of around 30 to 40 people and that Goode had been drinking .

Passing sentence Judge Pamela Badley told him : ` The idea that for fun that you can pick up a glass and throw it randomly into a group of people on a crowded dance floor - it was a matter of pure chance , you could have taken this young woman 's eye . ` You could have caused a very significant amount of injury to more than one person and at the time you had taken some cannabis and alcohol which is an aggravated fact . ` Unfortunately in the courts we deal with people who do n't look at the consequences of their actions . The fact that you have got to the age of 20 , have held down a job and on the face of it , a responsible young man , yet can can act in this way is extremely worrying . ` It has affected her confidence , she is going to have a scar on the face . She was n't even taking part in the hard-core dancing because she knew it would allow idiots to have free reign . ` The affect upon her has been significant , the scar to her right eye and swelling meant she had a great deal of anxiety .
