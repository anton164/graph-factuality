Manchester United 's pursuit of Edinson Cavani took another blow after the Uruguayan striker insisted he will be staying at Paris Saint-Germain until his contract expires . United have been considering a bid for the forward as they look to freshen up their forward options , with Radamel Falcao expected to return to Monaco , and Robin van Persie failing to hold down a starting place . But the PSG striker , who missed several chances during his side 's Champions League defeat to Barcelona on Wednesday , insisted there is ` too much talk ' about his future , and he is happy in Paris .

The Uruguayan forward is a target for Manchester United but looks set to stay in Paris . ` There is too much talk about my future but I will remain here , ' Cavani told Sky Italia after the Barcelona defeat . ` I will respect my contract and I 'm only focusing on doing well for PSG . ' Cavani has not been as instrumental to the club 's fortunes this season as he was last year but came off the bench to score twice against Bastia in Saturday 's League Cup final win . PSG are thought to have doubts about the future of star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic and should he leave they would certainly want to keep Cavani . The Uruguayan joined the French champions in a Â£ 50million deal from Napoli in the summer of 2013 . Club owner Nasser Al-Khelaifi ruled out his sale last week , claiming he is loved at the Parc des Princes . ` Edinson Cavani is a player I really like , ' Al-Khelaifi told Le Parisien . ` I can tell you that he is very much with us , and the question of his departure has not arisen .
