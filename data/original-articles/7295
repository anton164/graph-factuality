Tough challenge : The 36-year-old daredevil will walk atop the Orlando Eye as it turns on April 29 . The Orlando Eye team issued a statement saying it 's excited to have Wallenda attempt the ` amazing stunt . ' No distance for the performance has been set yet , but Wallenda , 36 , said he was not likely to walk the entire 20 minutes or so that it takes the wheel to go a full circle . Wallenda previously walked atop a Ferris wheel in Santa Cruz , California , but he said the size of the much larger Orlando wheel and the fact that he will not use a pole sets this stunt apart . The seventh-generation member of the ` Flying Wallenda ' family of acrobats has walked across the Grand Canyon and Niagara Falls . In November , he walked twice between two Chicago skyscrapers without a net or harness , doing the second walk blindfolded . Wallenda is the great-grandson of Karl Wallenda , who fell to his death in Puerto Rico at 73 .
