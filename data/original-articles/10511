You would think it would be a little intimidating . But for this tiny chihuahua , having a best friend 120 times his size is proving a great source of comfort . The diminutive Digby was abandoned on the street next to a set of bins . At just over a month old and weighing less than 1 lb , he was freezing cold and perilously close to death . Fortunately , he was rescued by the RSPCA and taken to their Southridge centre in Hertfordshire - where he quickly became inseparable from 9st mastiff Nero . Scroll down for video . New pals : Tiny chihuahua Digby with best friend Nero , a 9st mastiff who is 120 times the size . Digby was rescued by the RSPCA and taken to a centre in Hertfordshire where the two have quickly become inseparable . ` It was as if the little fellow took on Nero as his personal minder , ' said centre manager Anna White . ` Poor Digby had to be rescued once by the RSPCA and it seems like he is taking precautions to make sure nothing can happen to him again . ' Digby was found severely dehydrated and cowering between two bins at a block of flats in North London last week . But he was revived by the reassuring presence of the mastiff , who eats more than Digby 's weight in pet food each day . Natalie Ditchfield , RSPCA animal collection officer , said : ` It is so lovely to see he is safe and happy . ` Love story ' : Digby was found severely dehydrated and cowering between two bins at a block of flats in North London . But staff at the RSPCA say he has been revived and come out of his shell after finding Nero . ` When I first came across Digby he was frozen and shaking and had just been left to die . He 's really tiny - small enough to fit in the palm of my hand . ` He seemed to come out of his shell as soon as we arrived at Southridge and spotted Nero . It really is a love story . ' The RSPCA is appealing for information in a bid to trace Digby 's owner . Unless one comes forward , he will be available for rehoming in the coming days .
