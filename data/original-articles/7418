A six-year-old girl has been sexually assaulted by a boy of the same age in the classroom and playground of her school . But officers are powerless to act over the allegations , at a school in Blackburn , Lancashire , because the age of criminal responsibility in England is ten , so charges can not be brought against the boy . The girl 's mother has also blasted school authorities after officials refused to remove the boy from her daughter 's class , saying they have made the girl feel ` like she was in the wrong ' . According to the girl 's mother school officials refused to remove the boy from her daughter 's class , and she says she has now had to move the girl to a new school -LRB- posed by model -RRB- . The mother said she has now been forced to move her daughter , who can not be identified for legal reasons , to another school . She said : ` I informed the school and social services straight away , and rang the police . I had to keep her off school because the school said it was appropriate for the boy to remain in classes . ` They said they needed to speak to the boy 's parents and find out his side of the story . ` My daughter did n't really understand how bad it was . It has left her feeling very vulnerable . The way the school has acted makes her feel like she was in the wrong . ' The girl 's mother is also asking for a change to the law after police said they were powerless to act because the age of criminal responsibility in England is ten , and the boy is just six -LRB- posed by model -RRB- . The woman added that there needs to be a change in the law as children are becoming ` sexualised ' at a younger age , and said cases should be thoroughly investigated . Lancashire Police confirmed they received a report of the issue but that any action was the responsibility of the school and social services . Blackburn with Darwen Council said it was working to support those involved after the allegations .
