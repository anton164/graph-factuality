Andy Murray arrived back in Britain on Monday restored as world No 3 in the new rankings -- but set aside thoughts of that to focus on his wedding in Dunblane this weekend . And despite his recent tournament finishes getting him back near the top of the game , the 27-year-old Scot confirmed it will be a down-to-earth guest list when he marries fianc√©e Kim Sears in his hometown on Saturday . There are believed to be well over 100 people attending , but star spotters will find celebrities in short supply as the couple focus on celebrating with family and genuine friends .

The one possible exception is comedian James Corden , although he is busy working in America . There will be quite a few friends prominent in British tennis -- aside from anything Kim 's father Nigel has been one of the country 's leading coaches -- but with the Monte Carlo Open beginning next Monday the bigger international names were always going to be otherwise engaged .

I 'm not going to hit any balls this week . Pretty much everything is done now and under control . I 'm sure a few things will come up .
