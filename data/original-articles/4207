Former Manchester United midfielder Eric Cantona has refuted claims he starred in a soft porn film , insisting You and the Night is a ` piece of art ' . The French film has a number of racy scenes , and at one point sees Cantona on his hands and knees in just his underwear . But the 48-year-old is adamant it is not pornography . Speaking at the Laureus Sports Awards in Shanghai , Cantona said : ` Porn ? No , it 's not porn . It 's a piece of art . It 's just a piece of art . But you can see it like this . Eric Cantona was speaking to the media at the Shanghai Grand Theatre prior to the Laureus Sports Awards . You and the Night includes a scene in a cage , with Cantona alongside Beatrice Dalle in just his underwear . ` It 's beautiful . You should see it . Unfortunately , porn is not so aesthetic and so beautiful . But love is sex also , you know ? ` This kind of story for the ones who have seen it - I 'm sure nobody has seen it - it 's too beautiful . ` This kind of story , when you choose to do it , you have to know the director . If it 's somebody special , if it 's a real artist , you can do it . You can give , and be confident enough . ' Cantona has defended the film , saying it is ` a work of art ' and ` beautiful ' , and not a porn film as some have said . In one scene , Cantona is on his hands and knees in his pants while a woman with a whip stands over him . Cantona stars alongside French actress Beatrice Dalle , playing a character named ` The Stud ' , and the film has been both praised and slated in equal measure . While one called it a ` superb artistic orgy ' , another reviewer branded it ` a film that confuses the audience and falls in the gap between arthouse and trashy farce . '
