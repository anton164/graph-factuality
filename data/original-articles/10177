Jose Mourinho relishes the pre-match press conference . For the Chelsea manager , it 's where the game begins , especially ahead of a match like Sunday 's at Arsenal , where his side could move three points away from securing the Premier League with a victory . It was a surprise , therefore , to see him stumped at a question posed to him at the end of his media conference on Friday . Rarely , if ever , does the Portuguese coach not know what to say . But after going to great lengths to insist there are ` no problems ' with Arsene Wenger after the pair clashed on the sidelines at Stamford Bridge last season , Mourinho was stumped by the question that followed . Jose Mourinho was visibly surprised by a question he was asked at his Chelsea press conference . He was asked how hard Arsene Wenger pushed him , referring both to the title race and their clash last year . Mourinho praised the ` top question ' before composing himself and giving an equally ambiguous answer . Wenger -LRB- left -RRB- pushed Mourinho when Chelsea beat Arsenal 6-0 at Stamford Bridge last season . Sport analysts BSports are predicting a tight match , with Arsenal slight favourites to beat Chelsea . ` Jose , you said you 've been pushed very hard this season , how hard did Arsene Wenger push you ? ' Mourinho burst into laughter , covered his mouth in shock before turning to Chelsea 's media officer , swearing and saying ` it deserves a proper answer . ' He eventually regained composure , before marvellously disguising his opinion in a deliberately transparent manner . ` It is a top question , top question ... but because I am always honest in my answers , I can not answer you , ' Mourinho replied , cunningly .
