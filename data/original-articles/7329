A singing three piece of dogs exercised their vocal chords and produced a musical ensemble for the benefit of their owner . Captured in a front room in Bahama , North Carolina , the three dogs -- a Husky called Sky , a brown and white Springer Spaniel called Sadie and a black and white Springer Spaniel called Marshall -- take their positions on their make-shift stage . Getting the tune underway , Sadie begins barking and then rests her muzzle on Sky 's ear as if whispering something -- Sky reacts by playfully mouthing in her direction . The video begins with Sadie the Springer Spaniel barking and interacting with the Husky named Sky . The Springer Spaniel then begins barking some more and suddenly the Husky joins it , but instead produces a far more pleasant sounding howl . Following the Husky 's lead , the Spring Spaniel begins howling itself and before long the two dogs are musically bouncing off one another . Meanwhile the other Springer Spaniel moves about the room wagging its tail in an overly excited manner . No , it 's like this ! The Husky begins howling , causing the Springer Spaniel to stop barking and follow its lead . All together now ! The three dogs point their noses to the sky and howl together in harmony . Before getting itself into position and producing a sound somewhere between a growl and a baritone howl , which adds a further dimension to the music being produced by the duo . The trio now harmonising with one another kick the performance up a gear by pointing their noses to the sky and howling even louder . The howling goes on for quite a few seconds with none of the dogs -- who continue to wag their tails -- showing any signs of letting up . No encore ? The owner calls for quiet and the dogs stop howling and look at him in surprise . Eventually the video concludes with the filmmaker saying : ` Hey , hey , hey , come on , come on . ' And the three dogs , rather put out about being interrupted , stopping and turning to look at him in surprise .
