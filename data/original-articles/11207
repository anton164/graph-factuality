Puren - who has died aged 96 - was the youngest brother of the final Qing monarch Puyi -LRB- above -RRB- , who ruled for four years until 1912 . The brother of China 's last emperor who was pushed off the throne more than 100 years ago has died . Puren was the youngest brother of the final Qing monarch Puyi , who ruled for four years until 1912 . The 96-year-old died on Friday after being taken to hospital with pneumonia in February , his family said . He had been suffering from poor health and memory loss in recent years . One of his sons told The Legal Evening News that Puren - who took the Chinese name Jin Youzhi - was ` almost deaf ' . ` He even could n't hold a pen ... he could n't recognise people , ' the son added . Puyi became emperor in 1908 when he was two years and ten months old . His abdication ended the rule of the Qing dynasty , which began in 1644 . After the government took power in 1912 Puyi and his close family were forced to live within the walls of the Forbidden City , where they retained imperial traditions and were tended to by eunuchs . They were expelled from the palace complex in 1917 . Puren established a primary school with the help of his father in the 1940s and continued to teach until he retired in the late 1960s . He reportedly had three sons and two daughters . The Communist party which took power in 1949 also reportedly gave him a place on the local Beijing branch of the Chinese People 's Political Consultative Conference , a mostly symbolic body . A memorial for Puren will be held at the Babaoshan Cemetery in Beijing . The former emperor is pictured -LRB- right -RRB- with their father and younger brother in front of a beautiful picture .
