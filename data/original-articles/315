Police have charged a woman with fraud after she allegedly faked a terminal illness to raise thousands of dollars from sympathetic strangers . In August 2014 Elizabeth ` Elle ' Edmunds established an online fundraising page claiming she had ovarian cancer and seeking money for medical treatment . Police alleged the 31-year-old mother from Belmont , near Newcastle in NSW , used a falsified doctor 's certificate stating she had terminal cancer to raise about $ 2500 from her page . In February , Ms Edmunds told a Belmont Local Court she was put up to the act by her violent partner John Heagney , and did it because she feared for her life . Elizabeth ` Elle ' Edmunds , 31 , was issued a court notice this week for the offence of two counts of obtaining benefits by deception , after she faked having terminal cancer to raise money in 2014 . In October , a report was made to police regarding Ms Edmund 's activities , and detectives from the Lake Macquarie Local Area Command soon after launched an investigation . She was issued a court notice this week for the offence of two counts of obtaining benefits by deception , and will appear at Belmont Local Court in June . Police inquiries into the matter are continuing and investigators are appealing for anyone with information to come forward . Ms Edmunds went into hiding after revelations of her alleged fraud came to light last year . ` I was in fear for my life , ' she told Belmont Local Court , near Lake Macquarie in the Hunter Valley north of Sydney , at a hearing in February . She said Mr Heagney had tried to kill her and had severely beaten her on two occasions last year . Heagney claims Ms Edmunds faked the violence and was a self-harmer who punched herself , and that the two dates on which the alleged violence took place , October 20 and November 17 last year , related to the faking of the cancer . In April last year , Ms Edmunds sat her family down and told them she had cancer and doctors had given her just three years to live . She went to great lengths to present herself as a terminal cancer patient , shaving her head and faking hospital visits for chemotherapy treatment . Strangers set up a Facebook page and online crowd-funding account to raise money for her -- but the ruse was exposed in November when Heaghney posted a status update that Ms Edmunds was not sick at all . Ms Edmunds ' stepdaughter , Kyala , 19 , even got a tattoo on her chest in dedication of her stepmother when she thought she was dying of cancer . The tattoo read : ` Where there is love there is hope ... Elle ' . Ms Edmunds said she believed her mind had tricked her into believing she had the terminal illness -- and she even underwent chemotherapy using pills she bought on the internet . Ms Edmunds told Belmont Local Court former partner John Heagney -LRB- pictured -RRB- forced her to fake the illness . In April last year , Ms Edmunds sat her family down and told them she had cancer and doctors had given her just three years to live . Ms Edmunds said her father and brothers and sisters had been ` shattered ' by the cancer ` diagnosis ' - and even more so when they found out it was fake . At the time , it was believed Heagney then ended their relationship after learning of Ms Edmunds ' deception . In a hearing in February , Ms Edmunds said Heagney was devastated about the ruse , but not because she deceived him . ` He was shattered because we 'd been found out . He was in on it just as much as me . It was his documentation , doctors . ` I went through with it because I was in fear . ` I had to tell people that I had cancer under Johnny 's instructions because I had his gun charges and that was the only way for me to get off the gun charges , ' she told the court . ` If I had n't done it I would have been killed . ' It 's alleged the 31-year-old Belmont mother falsified a certificate from a Sydney doctor that stated she had the disease , and allegedly raised about $ 2500 from the page . Ms Edmunds ' stepdaughter , Kyala , 19 , -LRB- right -RRB- even got a tattoo on her chest in dedication of her stepmother when she thought she was dying of cancer . The mother from Lake Macquarie , NSW , went to great lengths to convince friends , family , and strangers that she had cancer , shaving her head and faking hospital visits for chemotherapy treatments . Last November , Ms Edmunds told Woman 's Day she genuinely believed she was sick . She said she believed her mind had tricked her into thinking she had the terminal illness -- and she even underwent chemotherapy using pills she bought on the internet . Ms Edmunds told the magazine she was sorry for her deception . The court heard today that Ms Edmunds last year pleaded guilty at Belmont Local Court to possessing unlicensed firearms , which she claimed were Heagney 's weapons . Ms Edmunds , who has fled to Queensland and says she is in hiding and living ` in fear of my life ' , arrived at court with her mother , Judy Edmunds , and three support people including a domestic violence refuge worker . Ms Edmunds told the court Heagney had made vicious verbal and physical attacks on her on the dates in October and November last year . She said a row had erupted on October 20 . ` John started to yell at me and call me ... a f *** ing dumb c *** , a stupid sl ** -LSB- and -RSB- nothing but a piece of s *** , I 'm going to kill you . ` Johnny ... punched me in the face with a closed fist . I said `` well , just kill me now '' . I went into the bathroom . He came from behind me and put his arms around and covered my face and nose and stopped me from breathing . ' Heagney said he felt he ` was having a nervous breakdown ' because he had been acting as ` a full time carer for Elle . ' Ms Edmunds -LRB- left -RRB- told the court Heagney had made vicious verbal and physical attacks on her on the dates in October and November last year .
