Thousands of cars aged three to eight years old were assessed on their failure rate , age , mileage and cost of repairs . The most reliable was Honda , with Suzuki second and Toyota in third place while Chevrolet and Mazda were joint fourth . Overall , the most reliable models were the Honda Jazz and Mitsubishi Lancer while the least reliable was the Audi RS6 , which was also the most costly to fix , with an average repair bill of £ 1,003 . Electrical faults were the most common across all cars , accounting for almost a quarter of visits to garages . Axle and suspension faults were also common , affecting 22 % of cars . What Car ? magazine compiled the table with the Warranty Direct website . What Car ? editor Jim Holder said : ` Honda 's success in the reliability index is chiefly down to low failure rates . But , when things do go wrong , the cars are also relatively cheap to fix . ` Reliability is always one of the key attributes buyers look for when considering a used car purchase , so manufacturers that consistently demonstrate durability will always do well with the consumer . ' The list price of Bentleys ranges from £ 136,250 to £ 224,700 .
