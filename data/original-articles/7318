Kurt Cobain , John Lennon , Freddie Mercury . Every rock band has a face . But what if they were seen as one ? In an unusual project by men 's face product company West Coast Shaving , each member of history 's most esteemed rock bands are blended into one . Scroll down for video . The face of rock : The members of 30 legendary bands are blended into 30 single faces . Some band members in particular shine through . At first glance , the photo for The Beatles looks like a blurry picture of a young Paul McCartney . Kurt Cobain is clearly visible in Nirvana 's merged shot . And the features of Eddie Van Halen dominate the image of Van Halen . John Lennon -LRB- second left -RRB- is touted as the ` face ' of The Beatles because he took the lead on many songs . But fans , and many others , will know Ringo -LRB- far left -RRB- , George -LRB- second right -RRB- and Paul -LRB- right -RRB- were equally pivotal . The Rolling Stones : These five faces are some of the most distinctive in the genre of rock . Ireland 's rockers : With raspy vocals and a healthy helping of leather , U2 made waves in the rock world . Red hot : The Chilli Peppers also earned a spot in the list of 30 top rock bands . The English rock movement : Led Zeppelin -LRB- left -RRB- and Black Sabbath -LRB- right -RRB- flew Britain 's flag . Guns N ' Roses : Beneath all that hair are five easily recognizable faces to rock fans . Others not so much . U2 is a bizarre mix of the Irish bunch , as is the Rolling Stones picture . And aside from a hint of Billy Joe Armstrong 's eyeliner , Green Day also blend into something somewhat unrecognizable . Publishing the project , West Coast Shaving wrote in ablog post : ` We wanted to include KISS with makeup , however the result was just a white and black mess . ` As for ZZ Top , that image was simple a mashup of sunglasses and facial hair .
