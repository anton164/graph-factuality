Real Madrid have 48 hours to make a decision on Javier Hernandez as the clock runs down on their first option to buy the Manchester United striker . Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said on Monday that the European champions would take stock of Hernandez 's situation at the end of the season . However , under the terms set out by United when they loaned the 26-year-old to Madrid , Thursday April 30 marks the end of the Spanish club 's ` exclusivity period ' to buy the player . Javier Hernandez is enjoying a fine run of form at Real Madrid - scoring three times in his last two games . Hernandez -LRB- centre -RRB- returned to training with his Real Madrid team-mates on Tuesday . Hernandez -LRB- second left -RRB- was all smiles in training , but the 26-year-old faces an uncertain future . From Friday they will no longer have first option and United will field offers of around Â£ 10million from West Ham , Southampton and Lazio . The Mexico striker who has scored three goals in his last two games has one year left on contract at Old Trafford , but his latest displays have boosted his valuation . Ancelotti said : ` It is a subject that we will evaluate at the end of the season . What I can say is that I have liked his professionalism during the whole year . He is enjoying his opportunity a lot , he has a high level of professionalism and for a coach to have these type of players that are always ready is very positive . '
