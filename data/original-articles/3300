Dietmar Hamann believes Bastian Schweinsteiger should leave Bayern Munich at the end of the season after losing his place to Xabi Alonso in Pep Guardiola 's side . The World Cup winner was an unused substitute in Bayern 's 6-1 Champions League win over Porto on Tuesday . And former Germany international Hamann thinks Schweinsteiger faces an uncertain future at the Allianz Arena , with Alonso viewed as Guardiola 's preferred midfield choice . Bastian Schweinsteiger speaks with Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola during training this week . Dietmar Hamann -LRB- above -RRB- thinks World Cup winner Schweinsteiger may be heading for the Bayern exit . ` The game against Porto was quite meaningful for two players in particular , ' Hamann told Kicker . ` Schweinsteiger has apparently lost the battle for a place in midfield to Xabi Alonso . I do not think Schweinsteiger will still be playing for Bayern next year . ' Meanwhile , Hamann also expressed his doubts over whether injured winger Franck Ribery would fit seamlessly back into the side when fit , given the form of Thomas Muller in his absence . ` It will also be quite tricky for Ribery , ' he added . ` If you have to make a choice between Ribery and Muller once Robben returns , I would always pick Muller . ' Ribery last played for Bayern on March 11 during the 7-0 Champions League win over Shakhtar Donetsk . Franck Ribery is closing in on a return to fitness after an ankle injury meant a period on the sidelines .
