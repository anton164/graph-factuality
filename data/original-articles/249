A 16-year-old filmed throwing a kitten against a door and flushing it in the toilet has been banned from keeping animals for ten years after it had to be put down because of the abuse it suffered . The teenager , who can not be named for legal reasons , had to look away as disturbing footage of Tilly meowing in distress as he threw her against the door was played in Swindon Magistrates Court . He claimed he was ` accidentally ' high on ` white rhino ' - super-strength cannabis - and was being egged on by friends when the abuse occurred . Scroll down for video . Disturbing scenes : Defendant flushes Tilly 's head in the toilet while high on super-strength cannabis . Tilly was held by her tail and dangled in bathwater . She was in such a sorry state when RSPCA inspectors found her that she had to be put to sleep . Inspectors said she suffered a lot in her short life . Owner Sarah Reeves was filmed throwing her cat against the walls , alerting the RSPCA to the abuse . The defendant admitted to two counts of causing unnecessary suffering and was given a nine-month referral order and banned for keeping animals for ten years . At an earlier hearing , Tilly 's owner , Sarah Reeves , 19 , was also given a ten-year ban from keeping animals . The RSPCA became aware of Tilly 's condition when friends filmed Reeves throwing the young cat against the walls of her home , where the male had been living for a month , the court heard . RSPCA Inspector Miranda Albinson said when she arrived , the cat was cowering under a blanket , weighing just a third of what she should weigh , cold to the touch and ` clearly dying ' . She said : ` This cat suffered a great deal in its very short life . ' Tanya James , prosecuting the 16-year-old , told the court : ` The vet was asked to consider all the evidence in relation to this defendant , and in his opinion , it shows him subjecting the cat concerned to mental and physical suffering when he flushed her in the toilet . ` The cat was further distressed when it was forced to cling on to him -LRB- the defendant -RRB- , and being dropped in the bath was a further traumatic experience . ` The cat would have been suffering considerable stress and anxiety throughout the incident . ` He states the cat was locked in the bathroom 24/7 and rarely got fed . ` He had been living at the address for a month , and said he had kicked the cat in the stomach in a play fight . ` He agreed he had been cruel to Tilly . ` On the day in question he had come back to the house and there was a group of males smoking weed and Sarah asked him to put Tilly in the bathroom . ' Mark Glendenning , defending the youth , said : ` The cat suffered at the hands of the co-defendant which is why it had to be euthanised . ` He can give no credible explanation as to why this happened , other than he did not give it any thought , which is worrying in itself . ` There is some talk he will have to rely on food banks , and he was effectively sofa-surfing . ' Linda Raine , Chair of the Bench , told the youth : ` This was a horrible incident . I notice you could n't bring yourself to even look at the video . ` Unfortunately we had to . '
