Anyone who has spent hours sitting in a traffic jam can attest that cars are not always the most comfortable spaces . But some are considerably worse than others , an extensive survey of motorists found . The most uncomfortable is the Nissan Note Mk1 with a score of just 80 per cent , according to the poll of 61,000 drivers . Hot on its wheels is the Hyundai i20 Mk1 with 81.01 per cent and Fiat Panda Mk2 at 81.49 per cent . The original version of the Nissan Note was named the most uncomfortable car in a poll of more than 60,000 drivers . The mark one Hyundai i20 was named the second most uncomfortable car , with 81.1 per cent of the vote . 1 . Nissan Note Mk1 - 80.00 % . 2 . Hyundai i20 Mk1 - 81.01 % . 3 . Fiat Panda Mk2 - 81.49 % . 4 . VW Passat Mk7 - 82.79 % . 5 . Peugeot 107 MK1 - 83.53 % . 6 . Toyota Yaris Mk2 - 83.93 % . 7 . VW Touran Mk1 - 84.00 % . 8 . Toyota Auris Mk1 - 84.49 % . 9 . Seat Ibiza Mk4 - 85.03 % . 10 . VW Polo Mk5 - 85.12 % . Three designs by German manufacturer Volkswagen make it into the bottom ten -- including the Passat Mk7 -LRB- 82.79 per cent -RRB- , Touran Mk1 -LRB- 84 per cent -RRB- , and the Polo Mk5 -LRB- 85.12 per cent -RRB- . Toyota had two entries , while Seat and Peugeot had one each . Unsurprisingly , it is brands associated with luxury that dominate the other end of the scale . Of the 200 car models covered by the survey , the ten most comfortable include five by Lexus -- which also took the top spot . The company 's RX Mk2 managed a score of 97.27 per cent , just beating its own GS Mk3 into second place -LRB- 97.24 per cent -RRB- . Jeep also made an appearance in the top ten , with its Grand Cherokee Mk4 taking sixth place with 96.55 per cent . And family favourite Volvo did remarkably well , coming it at third , fourth and seventh place . The MG3 came in tenth with 95.56 per cent . The second version of the Fiat Panda was also named in the top ten most uncomfortable cars . 1 . Lexus RX Mk2 - 97.27 % . 2 . Lexus GS Mk3 - 97.24 % . 3 . Volvo XC70 Mk2 - 96.98 % . 4 .

A spokesman for Auto Express magazine , which carried out the survey , said : ` Seat comfort is a big factor in motoring satisfaction , as it makes your time in the car that little bit more pleasant . ' It added : ` It 's a poor showing for Nissan with the Note MK1 languishing at the bottom of the seat comfort top 200 , although age may now be playing a part . ` Volkswagen wo n't be happy to see three of its models in the bottom 10 . ' The most comfortable cars in Britain are made by Lexus which has FIVE models in the top ten alone - with the RX Mark 2 top followed by the GS Mark 3 in second . Volvo has three cars in the top ten and the other two are the Jeep Grand Cherokee and the MG3 . Other categories in the annual survey include another comfort factor - ride quality . This takes into account how a car handles Britain 's potholed roads and other conditions . Top of this list is the Land Rover Discovery and bottom in the Honda Civic , said Auto Express .
