Former Arsenal flop Nicklas Bendtner was not included in the Wolfsburg squad for Sunday 's draw against Schalke as punishment for turning up late for training on Friday . The Denmark international was due to start the match but ended up being dropped from the entire squad after his poor timekeeping landed him in hot water with manager Dieter Hecking . The Wolfsburg boss probably did n't need an invitation to lose his temper after watching his side crumble to a 4-1 home defeat by Napoli in the Europa League on Thursday and was obviously angered when Bendtner rolled up late the next day . Nicklas Bendtner was dropped from the Wolfsburg squad for Sunday 's game after arriving late for training . Manager Dieter Hecking said that Bendtner would have started the match if he had n't turned up late . ` Nicklas was going to play from the beginning but our training session was clearly earlier than he thought , ' said boss Hecking . Sporting director Klaus Allofs added : ` There are a lot of ways of finding out when training is . And it is not as if there is that much traffic in Wolfsburg . ' Hecking , speaking to Danish newspaper BT , said : ` As a team we have some rules that everyone should keep . When you break those rules you have to take the consequences . But we have spoken to Nicklas and everything is OK again . ' Bendtner responded to the decision to drop him on Instagram on Sunday . He wrote : ` Stay strong and look forward . Mistakes can be made , but you got to deal with it and keep progressing . ' The 27-year-old has only scored once in 16 league appearances this season since his arrival in Germany last summer . Bendtner has only netted once in the Bundesliga since joining Wolfsburg last summer .
