Wales climbed to 22 , their highest-ever position in football 's world order , in the April rankings to move within eight places of England .

Aaron Ramsey looks to place a pass during Arsenal training at Colney on Friday . ` A few of the English lads joke we will never make it but we may have a game against them there , ' Ramsey said . ` I hope we can make it and we are catching them up in the world rankings . ` It is an exciting time , we have jumped up the world rankings again and it has been quite a turnaround from the time Gary Speed took over . ` The progression has been amazing and you can see the confidence in the group . ' Wales were the biggest climbers in the April world rankings after winning 3-0 in Israel last month when Ramsey opened the scoring before Real Madrid 's Gareth Bale bagged a double . Wales midfielder Ramsey admits the banter with the likes of Danny Welbeck -LRB- above -RRB- is starting to fly . And Wales could even secure a place among the top seeds at the 2018 World Cup qualifying draw this summer were they to upset the world 's third best team Belgium in Cardiff on June 12 . ` I have always enjoyed meeting up with Wales and representing my country , ' Ramsey said . ` It is nice to be there with your own people from your country and represent them . ` It is a nice break away from club football and a really enjoyable atmosphere . ' Chris Coleman 's side are currently unbeaten in Group B of the Euro 2016 qualifiers .
