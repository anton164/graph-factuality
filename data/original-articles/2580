With house prices soaring , it 's not easy finding somewhere to live . And this community has thrown in the towel . Meet Seattle 's rolling neighborhood of RVs , where each unassuming vehicle is a capsule home . The unusual format has been captured in a series of photographs by visual journalist Anna Erickson . Meet Bud Dodson , 57 , and welcome to his home : An RV in Seattle 's SoDo where he watches over the parking lot in exchange for a spot . No place like home : John Warden , 52 , has turned his $ 200 vehicle into his home after his apartment burned down years ago . There are around 30 drivers that float in and out of this parking lot in the SoDo -LRB- South of Downtown -RRB- area of the city in Washington State . One might not notice them in the mornings as hundreds of workers in the nearby factories , such as Starbucks , park up and rush into work . But on the weekends , as the rabble flocks back to their beds , this unique group remains . John Worden , 52 , has been living in his vehicle for years since his apartment burned down and he was left homeless . He told Anna his car cost $ 200 , and does n't drive very well . But for a home , it 's just about enough . Though plan on the outside , it is a Pandora 's Box inside , Anna tells DailyMail.com . ` It was scattered with trinkets that he had been collecting over the years , ' she explained , ` and a pile of beer cans that he was saving to turn in for money . ' For work , he panhandles while helping people find parking spaces at Safeco Field stadium , where he used to be a cook . People come and go for work in the factories nearby , but on the weekend it is just the RV-dwellers that area left . Daily life : Here Bud can be seen preparing himself a barbecue on the gravel outside his capsule home , one of about 30 in the community . Eclectic : While Bud 's RV is organized and functional , John 's is full of trinkets and belongings dating back years . Alongside him - most of the time - is Bud Dodson , 57 . While some are forced to move about regularly , Dodson , a maintenance man , looks after the parking lot in exchange for a semi-permanent spot . His home has its own unique stamp on it . ` He had really made the RV his home and taken good care of it , ' Anna described . ` It was more functional -LSB- than John 's -RSB- and a cleaner space with a bed , kitchen and bathroom . ' Whether organized or eclectic , however , each one is home . ` None of them seem to want to move on , ' Anna said . ` It 's not perfect but they seem pretty content . Move in , move out : Some have agreements to stay , but others have to keep driving around to find a spot . John works as a panhandler at Safeco Fields stadium , where he used to work as a cook . He is content with his life in between the usual confines of society . Personal : To many this may just seem like a parking lot but for these men it is a very personal space . ` Bud is very grateful , he said the parking lot owner is just such a nice guy to let him live like this . ' She came across them when she stopped to ask a seemingly homeless man for directions . ` We got talking , ' she said , ` and he mentioned that he lived nearby in an RV . I went round to look and there was a whole bunch of them . ' Curious , she spent about two months returning to the spot , meeting with the community and building their trust . ` These RVs are their homes so it 's a very personal thing , ' she explained .
