The Chief Secretary to the Treasury has been caught on camera knocking back drinks with a high-class call girl . But sadly for scandalmongers , the chance encounter between Danny Alexander and Brooke Magnanti -- better known by her former alias Belle de Jour -- was innocent . The two were snapped at Bar One in Inverness on Friday as part of the Nip festival , which celebrates the gins and whiskies of the Highlands . Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander pictured drinking with call girl Brooke Magnanti . Mr Alexander was snapped with Ms Magnati - also known as Belle de Jour - at the Nip festival . It comes as David Cameron faced a growing revolt last night over his ` flat-footed ' General Election campaign . Several MPs pointed the finger of blame at the Prime Minister 's Australian Election guru Lynton Crosby . And a former Conservative Cabinet Minister criticised George Osborne 's ` Dickensian ' message on ` Austerity Britain ' . The first signs of a Tory wobble emerged after last week 's polls suggested that instead of leaving Labour trailing , as Tory chiefs had expected , Labour is slightly ahead . And far from collapsing under the weight of massed Tory attacks , Labour leader Ed Miliband 's ratings have improved . In an outspoken intervention , retiring Conservative MP Brian Binley said : ` With the Election campaign well under way , Mr Cameron still appears to be standing apart and aloof , almost like a spectator . ' He added : ` Flat-footed and lame , we already look as if we 're running to catch up . '
