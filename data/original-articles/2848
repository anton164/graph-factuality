World No 1 Novak Djokovic became the first player to win the opening three ATP World Tour Masters 1000 events when he defeated Tomas Berdych 7-5 4-6 6-3 at Monte Carlo on Sunday . Djokovic had overpowered eight-time champion Rafael Nadal to reach the final , not dropping a set on his 2015 clay-court debut this week . However , the 27-year-old Serb did not have it all his own way in a rain-hit match against Berdych , who had forced a break in the very first game and later rallied to force a deciding set .

Berdych had signalled his intent with an early break , only for Djokovic to regain his composure and lead 5-3 before eventually closing out the first set after 53 minutes . The Serbian became the first player to win the opening three Masters 1000 events . Berdych battled to win the second set but could not prevent defeat by Djokovic . Djokovic was on court for almost three hours as he overcame the Czech in three sets . Djokovic was 3-2 up in the second before rain took the players off court for the best part of an hour . Berdych , the world No 8 who reached the semi-finals of the Australian Open in January , came back refreshed and broke at 4-3 before levelling the match with some powerful forehands . However , a string of unforced errors from the Czech in the decider then allowed Djokovic to move into a 4-0 lead , from which he closed out victory in two hours and 43 minutes .
