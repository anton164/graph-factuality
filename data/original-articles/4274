It was a tall order for workman but they have successfully completed the latest tourist attraction in China expected to draw the crowds . The new ` Skywalk ' observation deck has opened to the public in Yunyang County , southwest China , and those with vertigo are advised to stay at home . The cantilevered platform in Chongqing has a 720 degree view from a vantage point that stands nearly 4,000 feet above sea level . Its incredible viewing area protrudes nearly 90ft from the cliff face at the Longgang scenic area - which is more than 16ft longer than a similar tourist attraction at the Grand Canyon in America . Daredevils will be able to step out onto the transparent walkway to get a dizzying peak at the valley floor , a full 2,350 feet below them . Work on the £ 3.7 million structure started in March last year with builders facing a terrifying trip to work each day . It is now open to anyone who dares ... Overhang : Workmen apply the finishing touches to the cantilevered platform in Chongqing , which measures 27 metres from the edge of the cliff and 718 metres above the river in the basin below . Stunning views : The observation deck , perched on top of a 718-metre cliff , boasts incredible views over Yunyang County in China . Bottomless walkway : Workers remove the wooden planks and reveal the see-through walkway visitors will experience at the tourist attraction . Bottom up : The view directly below the skywalk shows how thick and sturdy the 900-tonne engineering feat has to be to support itself . Clifftop views : The blue sky can be seen through the transparent panels of the new £ 3.7 million tourist attraction opening in China .
