Huddersfield forward Jacob Fairbank is set for a lengthy spell on the sidelines after fracturing his ankle and suffering ligament damage while on loan at Halifax . The 25-year-old was injured in Halifax 's victory over Hunslet on Easter Monday and subsequent scans have left him facing an extensive rehabilitation period . Giants managing director Richard Thewlis told giantsrl.com : ` It 's another bad blow for Bobby who remains one of our most popular squad members . Huddersfield 's Jacob Fairbank , pictured during a spell at London Broncos , faces a spell on the sidelines . ` He was only saying the other day how much he was enjoying regular week in , week out rugby after his first uninterrupted off-season for a long time and was keen to push his way into Paul Anderson 's thinking . ` It 's too early to put a time frame on his return with swelling making a precise diagnosis tricky , but it goes without saying that he knows he will get every possible help here medically to get him back out onto the paddock as soon as possible .
