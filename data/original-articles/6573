Sherwood is being backed in the summer to bring in his own targets and many of them are the players Spurs did not think were good enough to make the grade in the Barclays Premier League . 22-year-old midfielder was player of the tournament during Australia 's successful Asian Cup in January . YOUTH CAREER . The Sydney-born star joined Tottenham in January 2011 after impressing on trial from Australian semi-professional outfit APIA Leichhardt Tigers FC . TURNING PRO . After featuring for the Under 18 side , Luongo made his only appearance for the Tottenham first-team during a 7-6 penalty shootout defeat by Stoke in the third round of the League Cup in September 2011 . However , breaking into the Spurs squad on a regular basis proved a tough task for the midfielder , who subsequently spent a spell out on loan at Ipswich in 2012 before two stints at Swindon Town a year later . Luongo made his move to the County Ground a permanent one in August 2013 for a fee of Â£ 400,000 . This season he has made 36 appearances in all competitions for the Robins - scoring six goals .

The Swindon midfielder made his debut for the Socceroos on March 6 , 2014 as a second-half substitute in a 4-3 friendly defeat by Ecuador at Millwall 's The New Den . His international rise continued just months later as he selected in their 23-man World Cup squad later that summer . Despite not featuring in any of their three World Cup group matches , the 22-year-old shone on the international stage at the turn of the year as Australia hosted the Asia Cup . Luongo played a pivotal role throughout the competition and in the final against South Korea he scored the opener in a 2-1 win - doubling his tally for the tournament . He was named Most Valuable Player of the Asia Cup too after also providing four assists for head coach Ange Postecoglou 's side .
