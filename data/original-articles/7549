Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has reminded Raheem Sterling and Jordon Ibe about their professional responsibilities and urged them to learn from a chastening week . Sterling , the England international who will lead Liverpool 's line at Wembley on Sunday in the absence of the injured Daniel Sturridge , was exposed for inhaling the legal high nitrous oxide on Monday . Then 24 hours later pictures emerged of Sterling and Ibe with shisha pipes . Raheem Sterling -LRB- right -RRB- was pictured smoking a shisha pipe with team-mate Jordon Ibe earlier this season . Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers -LRB- left -RRB- has n't disciplined Sterling -LRB- pictured -RRB- or Ibe for the incident . Ibe was present among the Reds squad during their training session on Friday ahead of their FA Cup semi . Rodgers , who has Steven Gerrard available for the FA Cup semi-final with Aston Villa , spoke to Sterling and Ibe in his office on Thursday but neither will be disciplined and Rodgers now wants to draw a line under the matter . He said : ` It is understanding that when you are a professional , elite sportsperson , there are things you can and can not be doing and be seen to be doing . ` It 's not just for your welfare but also because of your responsibilities . ` It is difficult . Some of these young guys are doing what you would consider to be normal things -- and I 'm not talking about this instance -- -LRB- but -RRB- how it gets framed is totally different . ' Rodgers would not discuss whether he would give Gerrard , available after a three-match suspension , an immediate recall against Villa , making it clear that his sole priority is steering Liverpool into their first FA Cup final of his reign . They fell short in the title race last season and then faltered in the last four of the Capital One Cup in January , but Rodgers thinks they are ready to progress . Reds have captain Steven Gerrard -LRB- centre -RRB- back for their FA Cup semi after serving a three-match suspension . ` When you get so close , whether it was in the title race or the cup , it hurts , ' said Rodgers . ` Trace back the winners in sport . If you look at everything they have won , also look at what they have lost . You will see that they go close on a number of occasions before they step on . ` Look at players who have won Champions Leagues and you trace back and see they have also lost Champions League semi-finals and finals . It 's all part of the journey -- losing but taking that forward and improving you . ' Rodgers -LRB- left -RRB- has n't revealed whether he 'll recall Gerrard for Sunday 's clash against Aston Villa at Wembley .
