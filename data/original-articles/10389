Carl Frampton has branded Eddie Hearn 's £ 1.5 million offer to fight Scott Quigg as little more than a ` publicity stunt ' . Hearn made the offer live on television on Tuesday after talks between him and Frampton 's promoter Barry McGuigan had stalled . But Belfast 's IBF super-bantamweight world champion has called on the Matchroom chief to make him a more realistic offer . Super-bantamweight world champion Carl Frampton -LRB- left -RRB- has dismissed a fight offer from Scott Quigg . Quigg -LRB- right -RRB- offered £ 1.5 m to Frampton for a British super-fight , via his promoter Eddie Hearn . ` It 's the biggest publicity stunt I 've seen since that incident between Justin Timberlake and Janet Jackson at Superbowl XXXVIII -LRB- when Jackson 's breast was briefly exposed by Timberlake -RRB- , ' Frampton wrote in his News Letter column . ' -LSB- It -RSB- is undoubtedly a lot of money . But does that mean I should snap it up with both hands ? ` Absolutely not , and there are a number of reasons why . ` It 's a flat rate offer , which means that no matter how well this fight does at the box office , this is the most I 'll receive . ` If pay-per-view targets are reached this fight can bring in £ 10million and potentially as much as £ 12m . ` So please , the next time you make an offer , make it a realistic one . ' Quigg showed off a £ 1.5 m cheque ready to hand to Frampton on Sky Sports earlier this week . But Frampton has branded the gesture a ` publicity stunt ' and ridiculed the offer . Hearn was quick to respond on Twitter , saying : ' -LSB- The -RSB- fact is we are putting offers on the table and you are n't ! If the offer is that bad then make us one ? ` Also , if it makes as much money as you stated in your link , why have you also turned down 60-40 for the winner ? ' Hearn has earmarked July 18 at the Manchester Arena for the world title unification clash with Nonito Donaire and Kiko Martinez alternative opponents for Quigg .
