Eight-year-old schoolboy Christopher Furniss-Roe , who hanged himself in a ` tragic accident ' An eight-year-old schoolboy hanged himself in a ` tragic accident ' after being sent to bed early for breaking his younger sister 's beach bucket , an inquest heard . Christopher Furniss-Roe from Pontypool , South Wales , was found in his bedroom by his father just 15 minutes after the ` childish ' argument with his younger sister . His father Jason desperately tried to save his son 's life but he died the next day in hospital . A coroner ruled it was a tragic accident - saying the eight-year-old was probably looking for ` sympathy and forgiveness ' after the row . The hearing was told Christopher was happy after being placed in a series of races at his school 's sports day . But after coming home from school that afternoon , Christopher has a ` childish ' row with his sister which culminated in her bucket being broken and her suffering a cut lip . Their father told his son to go to bed as a minor punishment , but after 15 minutes he found him hanging in his room . Mr Furniss-Roe cut his son down and performed first aid . But Christopher was taken to hospital and had his life support machine switched off the following day . Gwent coroner David Bowen said : ` Christopher had been naughty and as a result he had been sent to his room . ` It was far more probable that he was pretending to hang himself to get sympathy and forgiveness . ` But it all went tragically wrong . ` A heart-wrenching decision was made to turn that -LSB- life support -RSB- machine off the following day . ' Dr Stephen Leadbeatter , a consultant pathologist at the University of Wales Hospital in Cardiff , concluded that the youngster had died as a result of hanging after a post-mortem .
