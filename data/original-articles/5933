James Tomkins hopes to return to action with West Ham before the end of the season . Tomkins , seen with Stewart Downing , dislocated his shoulder in the gym underwent successful surgery . ` It depends on how well it goes . I 'm preparing myself mentally that I wo n't play again this season , so if I come back earlier then it 's a bonus . ` I was in the gym doing some exercises like I normally do , but just went a bit too far with one of them and unfortunately I dislocated my shoulder . ` I 'd have been frustrated if I had done it on the pitch , so to do it in the gym made it even more frustrating . Tomkins celebrates with West Ham United midfielder Kevin Nolan at Upton Park . ` I had the operation about two weeks ago and it has settled down . I 'm progressing with my rehab and getting more movement and hopefully I can get back as soon as I can . ` When you look at the fixtures , we have got quite winnable games , so I am confident the lads can get a lot of points from them with the squad we have got . ` I hope the lads stay injury-free and can push on and secure at least a top-half finish - that 's definitely our aim .
