Tottenham have been encouraged to make a bid for Marseille midfielder Florian Thauvin after the French club decided to listen to offers . The 22-year-old winger , who can also play behind the striker , was the subject of enquiries from Tottenham earlier in the year and has also been watched by Chelsea and Valencia . Marseille will listen to offers for highly-rated midfielder Florian Thauvin in the summer . Tottenham want to offload their fringe players first but are looking for attacking options . They are unlikely to pursue Everton 's Kevin Mirallas though . Manager Mauricio Pochettino has dismissed the prospect of goalkeeper Hugo Lloris seeking a move if Spurs miss out on the top four this term . ` Hugo wants to play the Champions League here for Tottenham and I think this is a rumour and nothing true , ' added the Spurs boss , whose only definite absentee is Kyle Walker . ` Hugo is very happy here and wants to reach the Champions League with Tottenham . This is his dream . ' Valencia and Chelsea have also watched the France Under 21 international in action .
