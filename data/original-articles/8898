Killing a spider is one thing but seeing hundreds of babies explode from its body afterwards would freak out anyone . This was the case in Hallett Cove , South Australia , when a man smacked a huge wolf spider as it scuttled across his kitchen floor . He got the shock of his life when he squashed the hairy beast with a broom , only to see hundreds of baby spiders came crawling out of the mother and spreading out in all directions on the floor . A female wolf spider scuttles across a kitchen floor in Hallett Cove , South Australia . The house owner is not too happy and promptly gets out a broom to get rid of the hairy beast . ` Ohhh look at the babies come out of it , ' the man says in surprise . The scene was greeted by the voice of a woman in the background saying : ` Ahhhhh , kill it !! ' A few more whacks later , and the tiny babies were running everywhere on the floor . But to his surprise after smashing the female spider a few times with the broom hundreds of babies appear . After giving the spider some more whacks for good measure , the man was heard saying : ` It 's dead . ' Finally the broom was used for what it was made for - sweeping up what was left on the floor . The Australian Repile Park website explains that after mating , the female wolf spider produces a silk mat into which she deposits around 100 eggs . Soon the tiny baby spiders are trying to make a run for it all over the kitchen floor . The silk is then rolled into a protective ball which she attaches to her abdomen and proceeds to carry it around with her until the eggs hatch . After hatching , the babies crawl onto the mother 's back and remain there until their fat reserves have been used up and they need to start finding their own food , which may take several months . That is unless the female spider is cracked a few times over the head with a broom . With the spider now dead the man sweeps it up as well as the babies that are spread all around .
