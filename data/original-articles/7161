Mo Farah will race over 1500 metres at the Sainsbury 's Birmingham Grand Prix in June , organisers have announced . The double Olympic champion over 5,000 m and 10,000 m will step down in distance for the Diamond League event on June 7 as he looks to hone his finishing speed ahead of the World Championships in Beijing in August . Mo Farah will race in Birmingham in the first time he 's competed in 1,500 m since 2013 . The race will be the first time the 32-year-old has competed over 1500m since he broke the European record by clocking three minutes 28.81 seconds in Monaco two years ago . Farah , who is unbeaten at the Alexander Stadium for seven years , said : ` It will be good to step down to 1500m and test myself over a shorter distance . Some of the best middle distance runners in the world will be in the field so I will have to be at my best to compete with them . ' Jessica Ennis-Hill became a national hero when she won heptathlon gold at the London 2012 Olympics . Farah and Greg Rutherford are set to compete at the Anniversary Games at the Olympic Stadium . Meanwhile , Farah will join a couple other Olympic gold medal winners from London 's so-called ` Super Saturday ' when he teams up with Jessica Ennis-Hill and Greg Rutherford to take part in the Sainsbury 's Anniversary Games . All three won their gongs the same day three years ago in the 10,000 metres , heptathlon and long jump respectively . They return to the Olympic Stadium as part of a three-day extravaganza involving some of the world 's finest athletes .
