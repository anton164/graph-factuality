Former Sunderland defender Danny Higginbotham has described a controversial speech made by Roy Keane which he calls ` one of the most bizarre team talks I 've ever experienced ' . Higginbotham and his Black Cats team-mates were about to take on Aston Villa during the 2007-08 Premier League season when Keane sat them down in the home changing room at the Stadium of Light . But instead of encouraging his players to put their poor start to the season behind them , the former Manchester United midfielder delivered an astonishing team talk .

Keane watches his Sunderland players in action against Aston Villa after delivering his ` bizarre ' team talk . Danny Higginbotham -LRB- right -RRB- gave struggling Sunderland the lead during the game on December 15 , 2007 . In his new autobiography Rise Of The Underdog : My Life Inside Football , Higginbotham - who scored in Sunderland 's 1-1 draw with Villa that day - describes Keane 's attempt to motivate his players . '' ` Listen lads , ' he said . ` Basically you 're s *** . Try and enjoy the game . You 're probably going to get beat . But just enjoy being s *** . '' ` Then he just walked out . Those words have got to be insulting to any professional , no matter who they come from , and I 'll admit it served as the perfect motivation to get out there and prove him wrong . I scored after 10 minutes and we were leading at half-time . We ended up drawing . ' Higginbotham also reveals how Keane once demanded for him to swear at and criticise his team-mates instead of getting behind them . Aston Villa winger Shaun Maloney -LRB- right -RRB- scored a free-kick to secure a 1-1 draw for the visitors . Keane is now part of Martin O'Neill 's backroom staff after leaving his role at Aston Villa earlier this season . Higginbotham -LRB- right -RRB- , pictured in action against Manchester City , played under Keane for a season . Referring to a talk with Keane , Higginbotham writes : '' ` Danny , all I 'm f ****** hearing from you when I 'm watching that game yesterday is f ****** encouragement . That 's all I 'm hearing . '' I thought , well , that 's not so bad . `` I do n't f ****** want that . I want you to tell some of them they 're being c **** . Tell them . ' '' Despite a 2-0 loss away at Bolton in the season 's penultimate game , Sunderland secured their Premier League safety with a match to spare . But although he had helped ensure another year in England 's top-flight , Keane was in no mood to praise his players after their defeat against Gary Megson 's side . Higginbotham -LRB- left -RRB- now works as a pundit after hanging up his boots in January , 2014 . Reliving his manager 's post-match team talk , Higginbotham writes : '' ` You 're the reason I 'm driving up and down the f ****** country to find another player , you 're not f ****** good enough , '' he yells at one player . ' `` Your attitude is s *** . You 're not good enough , '' he bawls at others . ' `` Next week we 've got our last home game , against Arsenal . You know at the end of the season when you walk around the pitch , thank the fans for their support ? I 'm ringing Umbro and getting you some hooded jumpers , because you 're a f ****** embarrassment , it 's a joke and this is not going to stay this way . '' '
