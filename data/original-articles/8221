Former Manchester United and City striker Carlos Tevez believes it is harder to score goals in Serie A than the Premier League . The Argentine , who has scored 36 goals in the Italian league since arriving at Juventus in the summer of 2013 blasted Premier League midfields as ` non-existent ' , and suggested defending is better on the continent .

Carlos Tevez , in action against Empoli in Serie A , says it is harder to score goals in Italy than England . The striker has 36 league goals in the Italian top flight since leaving England for Juventus in 2013 . ` It 's much easier to score in the Premier League , where the ball does n't stop moving , the action is everywhere and the midfield is non-existent , ' the striker , who scored 84 Premier League goals and won three titles , told Italian paper La Repubblica . ` Here you see a striker up against five defenders , it 's much more difficult than in England . The Italian league is of a high standard . ' The striker , who won the Champions League with Manchester United in 2008 , believes his Juventus team are more rounded than that side , and can repeat the success . ` That was a different situation , ' he added . ` There were some amazing examples : Cristiano Ronaldo , Wayne Rooney , Ryan Giggs , Rio Ferdinand , Paul Scholes . ` I think that now there is a team instead . We are very hard to beat . ' The Argentine striker scored 84 Premier League goals and won three titles with Manchester United and City . Tevez won the Champions League with United in 2008 , and believes Juventus can match that achievement .
