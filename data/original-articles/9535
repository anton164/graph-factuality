Manny Pacquiao literally got two words in before a conference call about his fight with Floyd Mayweather Jnr was abruptly cancelled on Monday . A spokesman for Pacquiao 's promoter blamed technical difficulties for the cancellation , partly due to the large number of boxing writers and broadcasters who were on the call . ` There were so many calls the system blew , ' Top Rank spokesman Lee Samuels said . ` We 've used the same company for 10-15 years and this is the first time this has happened . ' Manny Pacquiao 's conference call about his fight against Floyd Mayweather was cancelled during media event . The Filipino , pictured during last week 's media day , could only answer one question due to technical issues . Pacquiao was on the call from Los Angeles for what was supposed to be his last question and answer session before he arrives in Las Vegas next week for the May 2 fight . But the only question he answered was from a Top Rank PR person about how his training camp was going , to which Pacquiao responded ` very good . ' Promoter Bob Arum , who was also on the call , then got frustrated when the first caller in the queue was n't someone who was supposed to be in line to ask a question . ` Let 's reorganise and do this call some other time , please , ' Arum said . Samuels said there were so many people calling in that some were unable to get on the call . He apologised and said it would be rescheduled . Mayweather is supposed to have his own conference call on Wednesday . Pacquiao was put through his paces by trainer Freddie Roach during the open training session on April 15 . American boxer Mayweather is due to address the media in a conference call on Wednesday .
