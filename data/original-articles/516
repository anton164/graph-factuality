As day two of the Grand National gets underway , thousands of ladies dressed in outrageous or elegant outfits as they compete in the style stakes and take in some high-class racing throughout the day . The popular event has seen over 45,000 descend on Aintree for the perfect build-up ahead of Saturday 's main event , the Crabbies Grand National . Seven races make up the day as they saw Saphir Du Rheu , ridden by Sam Twiston-Davis , take home the Betfred Mildmay Novices ' Chase and following up from his second place at the World Hurdle at Cheltenham festival . A.P McCoy rides Don Cossack and Eastlake in what is his last ever Grand National festival , as he looks to leave the racing scene and his legacy with a bang . Side boob alert ! Some of the racegoers ended up flashing a bit more flesh than they bargained for . Hoping to be noticed : Ms Brown had certainly dressed to attract the attention of photographers in her newsprint dress and scarlet heels . Steady ! A lady needs some help getting off Aintree 's racing simulator , but a bride-to-be had no problems hanging on .

Most , however , were simply intent on enjoying the sunshine and , in some cases , the revels with many opting to start their day with a mini bottle of champagne , quaffed with the help of a booze funnel . But while many joined in with the fun , the sight of so many early morning drinkers has left bookmakers panicking at the prospect of a bumper payout following Coral 's decision to offer odds on such wardrobe malfunctions as falling over while drunk and showing off too much cleavage . ` If some of yesterday 's outfits were anything to go by , we 're in for a treat today for Ladies ' Day at Aintree , ' said Coral 's Nicola McGeady , whose company has priced falling over at 1/2 and exposed breasts and bottoms at 2/1 .

' Such episodes are something Aintree bosses had hoped to avoid this year , with the strict style code just one of a raft of measures designed to add some class to the image of the event which has suffered in recent years . Along with expecting ` Chanel-inspired ' get-ups from female racegoers , the management has also threatened to kick out any photographers caught taking photos of drunken racegoers . ` Our event is full of character , it 's fun , and that 's generated by the personality of the Liverpool people , ' said Aintree managing director John Baker in the run-up to this year 's event . ` We have to absolutely protect that because it 's at the core of what we are , and we have a responsibility to our customers to project the correct image .
