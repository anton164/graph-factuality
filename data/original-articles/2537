A woman mocked after she purchased a camera that allowed her to watch her cats from work is getting the last laugh . On Monday afternoon , the New York City woman , who is not being named , watched in terror as a man crawled through a window and proceeded to steal her laptop , digital camera and some jewelry from her apartment , getting out with the goods in just minutes . Unfortunately for the thief , the entire thing was caught on camera . A New York City woman caught a man robbing her apartment after he was captured on her cat camera . The woman is now thrilled she purchased the device and has handed the video over to police . ` I had to watch it a couple of times and be like , this guy is in my apartment and looking at my stuff , ' said the woman -LRB- above -RRB- . ` People thought I was crazy to spend $ 200 on a camera , plus another $ 100 a year to record the video so I could watch my cats , ' the woman told NBC 4 . ` But it really unexpectedly came in handy . ' The thief took her laptop , jewelry and a digital camera . Anyone who recognizes the man in the video is asked to contact Crime Stoppers at 800-577-TIPS .
