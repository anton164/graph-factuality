Real Madrid will not take up their £ 7.5 million purchase option on Javier Hernandez despite his winning goal against Atletico Madrid on Wednesday . Manchester United and Real Madrid agreed a potential deal last season worth around £ 15m to include the Mexican 's season loan . Lazio , Valencia , Dinamo Moscow , Newcastle , West Ham and Southampton are among clubs interested in the 26-year-old . Javier Hernandez celebrates after scoring the winner for Real Madrid against rivals Atletico on Wednesday . The striker will leave Real at the end of this season and return to Manchester United . The Mexican is wanted by a host of Premier League clubs including West Ham and Swansea . Hernandez has only started twice in La Liga for Carlo Ancleotti 's side and faces the near-impossible task of earning a regular starting spot with the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo , Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale ahead of him in the pecking order . The striker will return to Manchester United at the end of the season but does not feature in manager Louis van Gaal 's plans and will only have one year left on his contract at the Old Trafford club . Meanwhile , LA Galaxy and proposed new franchise LAFC are being considered by Ronaldo as possible destinations when his contract ends at Real Madrid . Ronaldo , 30 , is contracted to Madrid until 2018 .
