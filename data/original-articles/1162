Charlie Austin is being considered for a surprise England call up for the national team 's summer fixtures after scoring 17 goals for relegation-threatened QPR . Austin is in contention because Harry Kane , who scored on his debut against Lithuania last month and made his first start against Italy in Turin , will be with Gareth Southgate 's Under-21 team . The QPR striker will continue to be monitored by England head coach Roy Hodgson and assistant Ray Lewington ahead of the friendly with Republic of Ireland on June 7 and the Euro 2016 qualifier in Slovenia seven days later .
