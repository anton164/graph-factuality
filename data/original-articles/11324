' He added that parties in the fictional Ambridge are limited to nine attendees because of budgetary considerations . ` Sometimes you will hear two people saying `` oh we saw Barry the other day '' , and that 's because we could n't afford Barry , ' he told the audience at Chipping Norton Literary Festival . ` We can only have 39 actor bookings in a week , which is roughly six or seven in an episode . Sometimes if you have a big party you will have eight or nine , so it is up to us to decide with all of those restrictions how we are going to tell the tales . ' Actor Charles Collingwood , who joined the programme in 1975 , also defended the show 's editor Sean O'Connor who has been criticised for ` sexing up ' the traditional radio serial . He said Mr O'Connor ` is bringing in really exciting stories ' .
