Tom O'Carroll , a leading member of the notorious Paedophile Information Exchange -LRB- above -RRB- , has joined the supporters of the media pressure group Hacked Off . A leading member of the notorious Paedophile Information Exchange , which campaigned to legalise child sex in the 1970s and 80s , has joined the supporters of the media pressure group Hacked Off . Tom O'Carroll , a former Open University information officer and formerly a key activist for PIE , attended a Hacked Off rally in the Houses of Parliament on February 25 to lobby MPs for state involvement in media regulation . The organisation , set up in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal , is campaigning against what it sees as the ` biased and unfair ' Independent Press Standards Organisation . It wants MPs to set up a statutory body to regulate the press , as recommended by the Leveson Inquiry . The news that O'Carroll is a backer of Hacked Off will be an embarrassment to the group . PIE was formed in 1974 to campaign for sex with children to be legalised and formed an alliance with the National Council for Civil Liberties -LRB- NCCL -RRB- . The NCCL lobbied parliament for the age of sexual consent to be cut to ten as long as the child ` understood the nature of the act ' and apparently consented . The group also wanted incest to be legalised . O'Carroll was on the NCCL 's gay rights sub-committee . The 69-year-old was jailed in 1981 for ` corrupting public morals ' . He wrote a blog after the February meeting , chaired by comedian John Cleese , confirming his attendance . A Hacked Off spokesman said that the meeting was ` open to and free for all members of the public to attend ' . O'Carroll attended a Hacked Off rally in the Houses of Parliament on February 25 to lobby MPs for state involvement in media regulation , which John Cleese -LRB- left ; right in Fawlty Towers -RRB- chaired .
