Michael Vaughan , who is favourite to become England 's cricket supremo , was quick to condemn the openers after West Indies got them both out early on . With Jonathan Trott out without scoring in the first over and captain Alastair Cook failing again Vaughan said : ` Their footwork and their mindset has been about looking to survive rather than getting on top . ' Geoff Boycott was also critical of the pair , saying : ` Opening batsmen are supposed to face the new ball when it 's doing a little bit . If you ca n't play that , you 're in the wrong job . ' Michael Vaughan criticised the footwork and mindset of England 's top order for just looking to survive . Jonathan Trott was out for a duck on his return to the Test match side in Antigua . Alastair Cook was clean bowled by Kemar Roach for 11 as England struggled on the first morning . Former fast bowler Bob Willis said : ` England 's top three looked constipated and need a good dose of syrup of figs . ' West Indies ' early success after putting England into bat appeared at that stage to make a mockery of the comment by Colin Graves , the new England and Wales Cricket Board chairman , who labelled the opposition ` mediocre ' .
