It 's a shame to see another talented young player being photographed taking ` hippy crack . ' It might be legal but it 's still a drug . If you want to be a top athlete you do n't want that in your body . In a strange way , maybe this story will actually help keep Jack Grealish 's feet on the ground . He was outstanding against Liverpool but it was one game -- he has not made it yet . Jack Grealish -LRB- left -RRB- has become the third top flight starlet caught on camera inhaling nitrous oxide . Grealish starred for Aston Villa in their FA Cup semi-final win over Liverpool on Sunday at Wembley . At Arsenal , Arsene Wenger changed the attitude completely . He said as professional athletes we had a duty to look after our bodies . Alcohol was described as poison -- it slows down your body when it needs to be perfectly tuned . You eat what 's required to refuel , not for pleasure . Of course you still get players who want to enjoy themselves but there has to be a cut-off point . When I see Jack play it 's no surprise that he is full of confidence . He has a big future but he has to make the right choices . That 's how you make sure you are on the back pages , not the front . Emre Can of Liverpool tries to tackle Grealish during their FA Cup tie with Aston Villa at Wembley .
