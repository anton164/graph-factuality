CCTV footage shows him sitting in front of the computer and suddenly turning to his left to cough violently , before slumping in his chair and dying in front of shocked fellow gamers . Concerned onlookers called an ambulance for Mr Wu , who is understood to have continued playing the video game while waiting for the paramedics , despite clearly being seriously ill . Horrified fellow gamer Hsin Lo , 20 , said : ` I called for an ambulance while my friend went to get some help from staff . But while we waited he just died in front of us , and was nothing for the staff to do , ' Mr Hsin said . When medical crews arrived they tried to resuscitate Mr Wu but he was already dead .
