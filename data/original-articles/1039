Newcastle midfielder Rolando Aarons may have played his last game this season after suffering another injury setback . The 19-year-old was in contention to play for the club 's under-21s against Derby on Wednesday evening along with fellow long-term absentee Siem de Jong . However , it is understood he has succumbed to injury once again and it is feared his campaign could be over . Newcastle midfielder Rolando Aarons has suffered another injury setback and may not play again this season . The 19-year-old was in contention to play for the Magpies ' Under 21s against Derby on Wednesday . The Magpies declined to comment , but Aarons ' loss would be yet another blow to head coach John Carver , who has seen his side defeated in each of its last five Barclays Premier League games amid a suspension and injury crisis which shows few signs of abating . Midfielder Moussa Sissoko was sent off during Monday night 's loss at Liverpool to ensure his own enforced spell on the sidelines just as Carver prepares to welcome skipper Fabricio Coloccini back from a three-match ban . Carver can not call on striker Papiss Cisse , who has three more games to serve of his suspension , while Steven Taylor , Paul Dummett , Massadio Haidara , Cheick Tiote , Aarons and De Jong have all been missing for some time with most having kicked their last ball of the campaign . Newcastle had hoped Aarons ' pace and direct approach would give them some fresh impetus with their season having careered to a halt in recent weeks . The exciting winger has made only five senior appearances to date this term , the last of them on November 1 when he was used as a first-half substitute in a 1-0 league win over Liverpool at St James ' park.Ã‚ .
