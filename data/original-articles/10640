While most football fans face travel misery over Easter , Manchester City have laid on free coaches to take their supporters to London for Monday 's Premier League clash with Crystal Palace . The reigning champions have shelled out for six coaches to transport around 3,000 people to Selhurst Park , notoriously one of the most difficult top flight grounds for Northern club fans to reach . The move was made after TV scheduling for the 8 pm kick-off made it virtually impossible for supporters to return home by either train or plane on the same night .

Around 300 City fans have been afforded free travel on six coaches to take them to Selhurst Park . Meanwhile , hundreds of thousands of football fans are facing a travel nightmare this weekend because of the Easter rail shut down . Despite more than 30 Premiership and Championship games scheduled for the long weekend , large parts of the rail network are set to be closed for repair works . More than half the games are set to be affected by delays and disruption , forcing fans onto the roads . Many grounds will not reach full capacity over Easter as rail closures disrupt travel plans . Labour has accused the Government of failing to learn from the Boxing Day chaos , when nearly a million football fans faced nightmare journeys to follow their team . Ministers were warned of the potential problems in advance Labour has claimed -- but they failed to scrutinise the planned level of maintenance work . Every single major artery on Britain 's railways was shut down . No trains ran between England and Scotland or Wales on the East Coast , West Coast or Great Western mainlines . The Midland , Cross Country and East Anglia were also shut .
