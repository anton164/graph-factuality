First blood to United after their Under 18s saw off City 1-0 in the ` mini-derby ' . Kits aside , this was probably as far removed from Sunday 's big match as you could imagine . For a start , no less than 13 out of the 22 players on show at kick-off were English . Of those , 10 were Mancunian . Callum Gribbin was the matchwinner for Manchester United with a delightful free-kick . Ticket prices ? Entry was free and close to 1,000 gathered on the seats and terraces of Moss Lane for a match that kicked off at 3 pm on Saturday with half-and-half scarves nowhere to be seen . Altrincham 's compact 6,000-capacity home may not be Old Trafford , but it does have a proud history of its own . It was certainly a grander stage than a windswept Saturday morning on an outfield at United 's Carrington complex , where Paul McGuinness 's Under 18s usually ply their trade . The young Reds coach wanted to make the experience closer to what his tyros could expect should they make the step up to the seniors . And his side lined up with three at the back and supporting wingbacks in a formation seen more than once this season in the first team . In an even first-half the impressive Marcus Wood , from just down the road in Sale , came closest for City with an audacious chip . United manager Paul McGuinness saw his side claim victory in the ` mini derby ' For the home side towering centre-forward Marcus Rashford , another local lad from whom big things are expected , wasted two decent opportunities when put through . Just before the hour mark England Under 17 star Callum Gribbin made and scored the first . In March , the nifty-footed attacking midfielder went viral when United tweeted a clip of him showing outrageous skills to trick four Aston Villa players . He was at it again here , showing nifty footwork on the edge of the box and drawing a foul . After dusting himself down Gribbin stepped up to curl a delightful free-kick around the wall and beyond blonde Joe Hart-a-like Charlie Albinson in the City goal . Moments later it was almost two when full-back Cameron Borthwick-Jackson 's rasping 25-yard drive struck the angle of the crossbar and post . The same man looked to have gotten away with one when he appeared to clip Buckley in the box before sub Aaron Nemane hit the side-netting as the visitors looked for an equaliser . Dutch winger Javairo Dilrosun curled a free kick onto the roof of the net in stoppage time for City but that was all she wrote . The result leaves United , who have won two of this year 's cross-town clashes , two points behind leaders Middlesbrough with a game in hand . Injury-ravaged City however , have now lost both matches in the Barclays Under 18s Premier League end-of-season play-off series . FA chief Greg Dyke recently bemoaned the lack of first-team opportunities for homegrown talent between the ages of 18 and 21 . On the evidence of this entertaining 90 minutes high on skill and commitment , there are talents on both sides that may well deserve their chance in the On the evidence of this entertaining 90 minutes high on skill and commitment , there are talents on both sides that may well deserve their chance in the coming years .
