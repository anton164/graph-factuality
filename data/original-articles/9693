Four-year-old James Hayward had his toy gun confiscated at East Midlands Airport . A four-year-old boy was frisked by airport security and then forced to hand over his plastic nerf gun after it was deemed a security risk . James Hayward had arrived at East Midlands Airport with his parents , Phil , 44 , and Hazel , 38 , with his brightly coloured toy - which fires sponge darts - packed in his hand luggage for their flight out to Lanzarote . But security officers , who were described as ` over-zealous ' by the boy 's father , then took exception to James 's harmless toy when it was picked up on the system 's X-ray machines . They demanded he hand it over , and they also performed a thorough patting down and inspection of the primary school child . Dad Phil has labelled the security checks ` ludicrous ' and criticized how staff reacted in the situation . Mr Hayward , a software engineer , said : ` Fair enough they are thorough but it just seemed a bit ludicrous to take a plastic gun away from a four-year-old . ` We were so late by this point I did n't have time to stop and argue with them so we just had to leave it because we did n't want to miss our flight . ` I explained to James we would get him a new one when we got back from our holiday . We were going for 10 days in Lanzarote over Easter . ` I thought it was a bit over-zealous of the security staff considering how many people were trying to get through at the time . ` No wonder it was taking so long if they wanted to pat down every little kid .

The smile is back on James Hayward 's face following the confiscation of his toy gun at East Midlands Airport . The Â£ 6 plastic gadget was described as a semi-automatic soft dart gun by its manufacturers , and James was bought a new one off eBay when the family returned from their holidays . East Midlands Airport apologised for the inconvenience but pointed out they had offered to post the toy back to the family 's home in Doncaster , South Yorkshire . Defending the decision a spokeswoman said : ` The safety and security of our passengers is our first priority and all regulations on security are set by the government . ` This regulation states that no items may be permitted through security that resemble a prohibited item . ' The hand luggage restrictions on all UK flights is set by the Department of Transport , and while there is no specific mention of models and makes of such ` toy guns , ' the prohibited list does include ` replica or model guns . ' East Midlands Airport said that ` no items may be permitted through security that resemble a prohibited item '
