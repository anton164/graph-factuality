A devastated couple has launched a desperate search for their beloved pet cat after he disappeared following a 14-hour flight from Abu Dhabi to New York . Felix the cat has been missing for almost a week after he escaped from his crate at John F Kennedy International Airport . The two-year-old grey tabby belongs to Jennifer Stewart , 31 , and her 34-year-old husband , Joseph Naaman , who said the airline-approved pet carrier was damaged so badly -- apparently while being transferred from the plane -- that Felix was able to get out and run away . Jennifer Stewart and husband , Joseph Naaman , pictured with their cat , Felix , who disappeared April 1 . Jennifer told MailOnline Travel that she is n't satisfied with the way Felix 's crate was secured and transported on the Etihad Airways flight . She said his crate was tied down to a large metal pallet and cracked open , apparently when one of the straps got caught on something as it was being moved to a cargo bay after the April 1 flight . She said : ` To find out how he was transported , I was horrified , I was sick . They basically strapped him in like he was an old box . ` If I had known he was going to travel like that we would have looked for other alternatives . ` He is a part of our family . He 's like a dog . He plays fetch and hide and seek , and he 's the coolest little cat . ' The couple was told that the plastic crate broke open after one of the ropes became tangled on something . Felix 's plastic pet carrier was tied down to a metal pallet while he was transported on the plane . Jennifer said she is n't sure which company was responsible for transferring Felix from the plane , but a cargo manager called her and her husband into an office after they landed to deliver the bad news . ` We were in shock that this happened . At first I thought he was going to tell me that -LSB- Felix -RSB- died . ` He told me his cage was crushed . ' While in Abu Dhabi she spent weeks researching the best way to transport Felix and she initially booked a ticket with a different airline , but there was a problem with the reservation and she was forced to switch to their flight and Felix 's to Etihad Airways .
