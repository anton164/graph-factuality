We 're all guilty of it but there are some who do it more often than others . Experts say snacking is an important way to control hunger ; and while we would like to think we reach for something healthy like carrot sticks , raisins or a handful of almonds , more often than not it 's salty crisps , sweet biscuits or cheap chocolate that we tend to munch on . But why exactly do we snack ? And if we knew what the triggers were , would we be able to stop ourselves from reaching for unhealthy foods ? Scroll down for video . We 're all guilty of snacking , but there are some who do it more often than others . Femail has worked with dietitian Lucy Jones from The Almond Board of California to study snacking habits in the UK and identified three tribes of snackers : Snack Amnesiacs , Situational Snackers and Super Snackers . Ms Jones 's research has revealed the habits which lead us to nibble needlessly , identifying the behaviours and reasons behind these three distinct snack tribes : . Ms Jones told Femail : ` Snack Amnesiacs are mindless munchers who subconsciously snack , opening something and eating far more than they intended . ` More often than not , these snackers have no concept of what or how much they are eating . According to Ms Jones , those who are stressed out due to environmental or emotional pressures are Situational Snackers . This tribe often have busy schedules which causes them to skip meals . Then there are the Super Snackers . ` They are the snack savvy , who recognise energy lows and tummy grumbles and plan ahead . This tribe only nibble sensibly , as and when their body tells them to , ' Ms Jones said . Ms Jones is encouraging women to revamp their snacking habits by trying the 21 Day Snack Happy challenge : a simply snack on a handful of almonds once a day for 21 days . ` Snacking is important to help control hunger and provide essential nutrients . We all lead such busy lives and juggle a variety of tasks and commitments every day , often resulting in long gaps between meals . ` The Snack Happy Challenge works well because 21 days is the length of time it takes to form a habit , or swap a bad habit for a good one . Planning ahead and arming yourself with a handful of almonds will really help to get you through the day . ' ` As a high source of fibre and containing 15 essential nutrients , almonds are the perfect snack you can feel good about , ' she said .

If you are a Situational Snacker : . The Situational Snacker is a very busy bee and often does n't have the time to prepare and eat a full meal during her day . To fill up , the situational snacker will grab snacks throughout the day , whilst she can . Nibbling on the children 's packed lunch leftovers for breakfast whilst she chops up the carrots , snacking in the car for lunch after doing the food shop , or quickly scoffing half a sandwich before the company meeting is common for this type of snacker . If you 're a ` Situational Snacker ' you might find that emotional pressures , stress and a particularly busy day can cause you to snack , even if not hungry , and you may be particularly prone to pick at food as a comfort mechanism . Lucy Jones ' advice : ` Almost three quarters -LRB- 73 per cent -RRB- of women in the UK said that stress lead them to overlook their nutrient intake . This is an issue I often see , and it can have a serious impact on health . If women are n't dedicating time to their diet and thinking carefully about their nutrient intake , they could be at risk of over or under eating . ` The key is to snack sensibly and make sure you have something nutritious to nibble on at your desk , in the kitchen , in the car , or wherever the hunger pangs strike . The nutrients in almonds make them a perfect snack to enjoy between meals . Almonds are also a high source of magnesium , which contributes to a reduction of tiredness and fatigue , so they really are the perfect snack to keep you going through a busy day . ' If you are a Snack-Amnesiac : . Throughout her day , the Snack-Amnesiac will graze on the foods closest to hand , without even realising she 's doing it . Munching through a share-size bag of crisps whilst watching the telly when she only meant to eat a handful , reaching for the plate of biscuits during a lull in the board meeting and even waking up in the middle of the night and sleepwalking to the kitchen to nibble on some leftovers from the fridge are just a few examples of the mindless snacking habit in action . Do you find yourself opening a packet of biscuits only meaning to eat one , but suddenly the packet is empty ? If you were asked to remember everything you 'd nibbled on throughout the day , would you remember every mouthful ? If you find yourself snacking on food without even realising , you could well be a Snack-Amnesiac and you 're not alone -- research commissioned by the Almond Board of California has shown that 90 per cent of women in the UK admit to snacking mindlessly throughout the day . Lucy Jones ' advice : ` Research has shown that women are typically lacking in fibre and often eat higher levels of the daily recommended allowance of saturated fat . ` With 90 per cent of women suspected of suffering from Snack-Amnesia1 and eating anything close to hand without taking the nutrient content into account , it is n't difficult to see how diets become unbalanced . However , if you are a ` Snack Amnesiac , ' there are easy ways you can ensure you 're still achieving a balanced diet . Almonds are a high source of fibre and just a handful -LRB- approximately 30g or 23 almonds -RRB- a day can boost your nutrient intake . These great little nuts are also high in unsaturated fat , and in fact , a recent study published in the European Journal of Nutrition found that a mid-morning snack of almonds helped control appetite and resulted in reduced calorie intake by the participants during the rest of the day . If Snack-Amnesiacs keep a handful of almonds close by , this could help to curb the cravings and the mindless munching later in the day . If you are a Super Snacker : . The Super Snacker is a woman who is well aware of her snacking habits and despite a busy day , or the odd sweet craving , she 'll do what she can to stay strong and find the foods she needs to help get her through -- no matter what the day might bring . Busy day of meetings and no time for lunch -- the super snacker will ensure she 's got a steady supply of her favourite nutritional snacks pre-packed and close to hand to see her through . Prone to an afternoon lull -- the Super Snacker will have a nutritious pick-me up ready to go . Craving an evening treat after a long day -- the Super Snacker will reach for a snack from the well-stocked healthy snack jar . Do you pack a snack in your handbag each day ? Are you familiar with the times of day that you need an extra boost ? If so , like one in five women in the UK , you could be a Super Snacker . Lucy Jones ' advice : ` Well-balanced snacking is a great way to stay on top of your hunger pangs and ensure a daily dose of the nutrients that your body needs . But healthy and happy snacking need n't be difficult or dull . ` As most Super Snackers know , there are some simple tricks to help adopt happy snacking habits . Mixing up different textures and flavours adds variety to your daily food intake . ` Pack a punch with a nutritiously crunchy handful of almonds added to some mango for sweetness , or even dark chocolate for a more indulgent snack .
