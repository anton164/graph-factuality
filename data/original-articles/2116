What would you get if one of the Queen 's corgis ran off with one of Sir Ranulph Fiennes 's Siberian huskies and had a puppy ? A corgski , of course , just like Max . At just 18.5 in from foot to shoulder , this diminutive fellow looks as if he was the runt of his litter . He is , in fact , a fully grown husky-corgi cross . But , unbelievably , Max has been abandoned and he 's looking for a home . He 's become a favourite with workers at the Dogs Trust in Basildon , Essex , who have been looking after him since he was found . Max -LRB- pictured -RRB- is a 18.5 in high fully-grown husky corgi cross . After being abandoned , he has now taken refuge at the Dogs Trust in Basildon , Essex . Huskies , such as the one pictured , have become increasingly popular due to shows such as Game of Thrones . Pictured is a typical Welsh corgi . Max is part corgi , part husky , and is looking for a new home . ` It quickly became apparent that he was the epitome of the saying good things come in small packages , ' says the Trust 's Sam Davis . ` He caught the eye of our staff when he arrived , but as he was found as a stray , little is known about his life before . ' Max is described as gentle , intelligent and big-hearted . There are currently 54 other wolf-like breeds being cared for by the charity 's network of animal rehousing centres . The Trust is in no doubt that the trend is partly due to fans wanting to follow the stars of Game Of Thrones and Twilight , which have popularised wolf-like dogs such as Alaskan Malamutes and Siberian huskies . But many new owners are often unprepared to cope with the specific exercise and socialisation requirements of these breeds -- and make a lifetime commitment to them -- resulting in a significant number eventually being abandoned .
