Two women , who were believed to be off-duty Ryanair members of staff wearing their staff lanyards , were passengers on the plane and were not wearing their uniform .

Speaking to Independent.ie a passenger named Bridget who was travelling on the flight spoke of how once the plane had taken off , two women were spotted coming out of the cockpit . Ryanair has since confirmed there were a total of three off-duty workers on board the flight . The passenger also claimed she had seen the two women ` drinking in the airport ' before the flight out . She said : ` Later , when the captain said ` we 're getting ready to descend ' , the two girls went back up . They were laughing and giggling and taking photos of each other .

These were three Ryanair employees travelling off duty . ` All three were wearing their Ryanair ID and were known to the flight crew . ` Following the investigation the matter is now closed .
