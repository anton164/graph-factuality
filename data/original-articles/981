Former Premier League referee Mark Halsey has slammed the FA 's decision to put Jon Moss in charge of the FA Cup final instead of Mark Clattenburg . Halsey said the English game would be a ` laughing stock ' over the decision to ignore Clattenburg , one of only two English referees in the UEFA elite ranks -- for the final between Aston Villa and Arsenal on May 30 . ` Greg Dyke -LRB- Chairman of the FA -RRB- has got to look at the appointment process for the FA Cup referee because , frankly , it 's a joke , ' said Halsey . Mark Halsey has slammed the decision to overlook Mark Clattenburg -LRB- above -RRB- for the FA Cup final on May 30 . Former Premier League referee Halsey -LRB- middle -RRB- has called the Football Association 's decision ` a joke ' ` I do n't blame Jon Moss . But is he the best man for the job ? Absolutely not . ` It 's clear Mark Clattenburg should be in charge . He 's consistently our outstanding referee who proves himself on the biggest stage . ' Halsey thinks Clattenburg , who has never refereed an FA Cup final , has been overlooked as The Professional Game Match Officials Board -LRB- PGMO -RRB- would prefer Martin Atkinson to go to Euro 2016 next summer . ` We 'll be a laughing stock around the world , ' Halsey wrote on sports networking site Kicca . ` I do n't think the hierarchy want Clattenburg to go the European Championship next summer . This is their way of sending out a message to UEFA that Clattenburg is n't our top ref . ' Halsey also said the English game would be a ` laughing stock ' over the decision to ignore Clattenburg . Jon Moss will take charge of FA Cup final at Wembley between Arsenal and Aston Villa .
