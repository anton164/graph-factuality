Manchester City have emerged as the biggest threat to Arsenal in the race for Charlton 's highly-rated defender Joe Gomez . The England Under-19 defender , valued at Â£ 8m by the Championship team , is one of the most wanted young players in the country after his breakthrough season at The Valley . City , beaten 3-1 by Chelsea in the first leg of the FA Youth Cup final on Monday evening , are determined to sign more young English players . Joe Gomez has played at right back for Charlton this season and is wanted by Manchester City and Arsenal . Gomez has emerged as a key talent in the England junior set up , but his rapid progress at first team level with Charlton has alerted City . He has been earmarked to play centre half in the future , but he initially broke into the Charlton side at right back . Gomez , 17 , signed a three year contract at Charlton in November last year , but the Addicks face a battle to hold on to their rising star in the summer . Manchester City lost to Chelsea in an FA Youth Cup final first leg and are looking for young English players .
