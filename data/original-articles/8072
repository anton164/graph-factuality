A ` despicable ' thief who stole £ 60 from an epileptic woman 's handbag after she collapsed and suffered a violent fit is being hunted by police . Detectives have released a CCTV image of a woman they want to trace after the money was stolen in Ryemarket Shopping Centre , Stourbridge , West Midlands . The female victim collapsed and started violently fitting in a seizure that lasted 20 minutes , leaving her in ` great distress ' . Passers-by rushed to comfort her but police believe one person took advantage of the drama , reaching into the woman 's handbag and stealing £ 60 cash . Officers said the CCTV showed a woman moving the victim 's shopping trolley before leaving the market on the afternoon of April 7 , West Midlands Police said . She has been described as a white woman in her 30s or 40s , around 5ft 5in tall and with long dark hair which was tied back in a ponytail . Detective Inspector Nigel Smith said : ` It 's a truly despicable crime . ` The lady is clearly in great distress on the floor and , while most people 's immediate concern is for her well-being , one person sees it as an opportunity to steal from her . ' The victim made a full recovery and only realised her money had gone after the incident . Mr Smith added : ` We 've secured a CCTV image of a woman we need to speak to about the theft . ` She is one of around 12 people who were stood near the lady but is seen to quickly leave having put her hand on the shopping trolley . ` We 'd urge anyone who believes they recognise the person in the CCTV to contact us . ' Anyone with information about the incident , which happened on the afternoon of April 7 , is urged to call police on 101 . The female victim collapsed and started violently fitting in a seizure at Ryemarket Shopping Centre , Stourbridge .
