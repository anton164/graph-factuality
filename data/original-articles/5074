He joined the Great War Display Team , saying : ` Flying has been my favourite thing all my life , especially aerobatics . I do n't do any other kind of sport . Flying is quite enough to keep me going . ' Determined to teach younger generations of the bravery of the First World War pilots , he said in 2007 : ` I am afraid that the public 's grasp of history today is pathetic . ` If we can help people understand a bit more about what happened in the Great War , then it has to be worthwhile . ' In 2010 , Mr Gregory and some of his fellow pilots took part in a mock dogfight over the New Forest to celebrate the centenary of the former Royal Fying Corps airfield at East Boldre . He finally quit flying in 2013 , saying of his beloved biplane : ` I will miss it terribly , but it is difficult to get in and out of and very hard to start . '
