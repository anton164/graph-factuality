Chelsea goalkeeper Thibault Courtois insists he has not lost any sleep over his high-profile errors of recent weeks . The Belgian was exceptional for the Blues in their win over Queens Park Rangers on Sunday . It was a far cry from his displays in Chelsea 's previous two matches , however . Thibaut Courtois -LRB- centre -RRB- was in phenomenal form as Chelsea beat rivals Queens Park Rangers on Sunday . Courtois -LRB- centre -RRB- has struggled in previous weeks and his error led to a goal for Hull on March 22 . Courtois cut a despondent man against Hull -LRB- left -RRB- but was back on form against QPR on Sundat . His poor touch allowed Abel Hernandez to score in Chelsea 's 3-2 win over Hull on March 22 before Stoke 's Charlie Adam beat him from 66 yards last weekend . But Courtois says his confidence levels have not waned as a result . ` I never doubted that I ca n't catch the ball . Against Hull , I just tried to make the best solution , ' he said . ` It was not the best control , but in the second half I showed that I am mentally strong and I saved the team . ` Against Stoke , if you want to play high as a team , you as a goalkeeper have to play high as a team as well . Charlie Adam did a good strike and that can happen . ` But I showed against QPR that if you play high , you can go get the ball from the midfield . If I 'm on the 16 yard box , I can go get it there . For me it 's not a problem . Courtois has also faced criticism for failing to keep out Charlie Adam 's 66-yard strike against Stoke . Courtois -LRB- right -RRB- said he never doubted himself during his indifferent spell of form for Chelsea . ` I continue . I never doubt myself . That 's my strength . I helped the team with two good saves against QPR and I 'm happy . ` The most important thing is the team and against Hull and Stoke we still won . ` I 'm 22 and still learning . These were moments which I could learn from . '
