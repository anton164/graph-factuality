The Labour candidate in Britain 's most marginal seat was last night accused of failing to tell voters that she met Vladimir Putin in Moscow two years ago when a controversial billion-dollar arms deal was signed . Tulip Siddiq , a former aide to Ed Miliband , and who is standing for Labour in Hampstead , was at the Kremlin with her aunt , the hardline leader of Bangladesh who is accused of human rights abuses . A smiling Ms Siddiq was photographed alongside Putin and Sheikh Hasina , the Prime Minister of Bangladesh and Ms Siddiq 's mother Rehana . Labour candidate Tulip Siddiq -LRB- left -RRB- was last night accused of failing to tell voters that she met Vladimir Putin -LRB- right -RRB- in Moscow two years ago . But the Tories last night accused Ms Siddiq of trying to conceal her extraordinary links to Putin and Sheikh Hasina . They claimed she appears to have gone to great lengths to cover up her trip in January 2013 -- just six months before she won a hotly-contested Labour selection contest in Hampstead -- and her links with Hasina . The Tories also said she had deleted postings and photographs on her blog which showed how she campaigned to get her aunt re-elected . And they questioned why her 1,200-word official Labour profile made no mention of Putin , the arms deal or being a member of a ruling Bangladeshi dynasty . A Tory official said : ` It seems very odd that Ms Siddiq has appeared to try to conceal the most interesting parts of her political life . ' Retiring Labour MP Glenda Jackson won Hampstead with a majority of just 42 in 2010 . Last night a Labour spokesman said : ` Tulip is proud of her background and has always been very open about it . ' As for the photograph , the spokesman said : ` Tulip was totally separate from any official delegation but was invited to an event with her family . ' The Tories last night accused Ms Siddiq of trying to conceal her extraordinary links to Russian President Vladimir Putin -LRB- pictured -RRB- .
