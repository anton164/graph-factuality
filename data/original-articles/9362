This too-close-for-comfort video shows a swirling ` landspout ' tornado tearing up the Texas countryside from just 100 yards away . Daredevil Stan Cole , an Iraq veteran , captured the wall of wind as it gulped up dust from the fields in Loraine , western Texas . He took the footage with his friend Ricky Bailey while the two were out in a tractor on Wednesday evening . Scroll down for video . Vortex : Stan Cole , an Iraq and Afghanistan veteran , filmed this landspout from just 100 yards away in Loraine , Texas . Cole told local news station KTXS that he felt chunks of mud start hitting the vehicle , at which point the two hopped out and started filming . He said : ` Perhaps 10 years in Iraq and Afghanistan , my danger meter needs to be recalibrated ' . Landspouts - the scientific term for tornadoes which are not part of a thunderstorm - can be difficult to capture on film . The wind formations tend not to last much longer than 15 minutes , and are too small-scale to appear on weather radars . Other landspout photographs emerged Wednesday night from the area around Loraine . Various social media users posted images of a clearly-defined spout working its way through fields - though it is not clear whether that was the same spout captured in Cole 's video . Spotted : Other photographs from Loraine showed landspouts - a term for any tornado not attachde to a thunderstorm - on Wednesday evening . Unexpected : Landspouts are not easy to predict because the wind formations that form them are too small to be picked up on radar .
