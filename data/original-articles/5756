Burnley striker Danny Ings insists he is aiming to play and develop wherever he ends up next season . Ings , who has scored nine Premier League goals , is a target for Manchester United and Liverpool . Speaking to The Independent , Ings said : ` One thing I do n't want to do is go somewhere and , not rot , but all of a sudden disappear for a while . -LSB- Somewhere -RSB- you do n't really get a look-in . I always back myself and no matter what step I take next I want to do well . ` One thing I do want next year no matter where I am -- and I do n't know where that is going to be -- is to work with a manager who is going to coach me and really develop me as a player . That 's all you can ask for , to learn and be the best you can be . It is important that you do get football . A lot of other things can suck you in when it comes to moves and I am sure that it has happened in the past to people . My main aim next year is , wherever I am , to play football and to enjoy it and develop . ` You do n't want to have a good couple of years , come through the Championship , have a good first year in the Premier League and then not play in the Premier League for another year or so because that is a backward step . No matter what contract anyone is on it is important that you are playing football . It is a short career and you have to earn a living but at the same time playing football is the best way to get better contracts anyway . That 's the way I look at things . '
