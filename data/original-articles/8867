Hamilton was relaxed . Vettel was downcast , but said that the race may be a different story from qualifying . Hamilton set his fastest time on his penultimate lap . It was enough . Rosberg , though , got closer to Hamilton than he has recently , perhaps heeding the advice of Niki Lauda , his team chairman , who told him via Sportsmail to ` sort himself out ' . McLaren will be towards the back of the grid . Jenson Button will start 17th and Fernando Alonso 18th . Barely a hair 's breadth separated the two former champions . A naturally disappointed Button said : ` The car did n't feel bad so it 's interesting when you find a good balance but the lap time is not there . We 've made good improvements this weekend , but qualifying just was n't for us . ` Hopefully we 'll be racing the cars in front tomorrow , but we hoped to be competing with them in qualifying as well . ' Sebastian Vettel qualified third but could threaten Hamilton 's supremacy with the Ferrari stronger than Mercedes over a long run . Rosberg waves to the crowd after qualifying on the front row , but the German was clearly frustrated to have missed out on pole position . Hamilton 's impressive lap on his first run on Q3 was enough to claim his third successive pole at the Chinese Grand Prix . Vettel starts ahead of Williams pair Felipe Massa and Valtteri Bottas , with Ferrari team-mate Kimi Raikkonen down in sixth place as he struggled in Q3 , with his best lap in Q2 . Red Bull 's Daniel Ricciardo was seventh quickest ahead of the Lotus of Romain Grosjean , with Sauber pair Felipe Nasr and Marcus Ericsson performing superbly to claim ninth and 10th . Pastor Maldonado lines up 11th , missing out on a place in the top 10 by seven thousandths of a second , with Daniil Kvyat a surprisingly lowly and disappointing 12th in his Red Bull . Jenson Button out-qualified Fernando Alonso for the second consecutive race , but will only start 17th for McLaren . Fernando Alonso starts 18th in Shanghai and will have the Manor cars of Will Stevens and Roberto Merhi for company at the back of the grid . Toro Rosso rookies Max Verstappen and Carlos Sainz Jr start 13th and 14th , with Sergio Perez 15th in a Force India that is off the pace as the team 's financial issues means they will not have their new car on the grid until June . From the initial 18-minute session , Force India 's Nico Hulkenberg led the list of departees , finishing three tenths of a second behind team - mate Perez . For the first time this season Manor had both cars taking part in qualifying , with both also comfortably finishing within the 107 per cent rule . Will Stevens , forced to sit out qualifying and the races in Australia and Malaysia due to issues , finally enjoyed a one-lap session . The 23-year-old Briton will start 19th , eight tenths of a second ahead of Roberto Merhi , albeit three seconds behind Alonso , underlining that whilst Manor are fighting , they still have a lot of work to do .
