Wealth : Training consultant Jay Rutland , 34 , with his 30-year-old billionaire wife Tamara Ecclestone . The husband of billionaire heiress Tamara Ecclestone earned just £ 65 a week from his firm last year , it was revealed today . Jay Rutland , 34 , who is married to the 30-year-old daughter of Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone , saw his company bring in just £ 3,378 over the 12 months to July 2014 . The training consultant 's firm Brigante Business Developments , based in Battersea , south-west London , is listed in company records as providing ` management consultancy activities ' . Its latest accounts for the year to July 2014 were filed to Companies House a fortnight ago , showing the company - which was incorporated in July 2012 - having total net assets of £ 3,378 , down from £ 18,131 the year before . The former stockbroker - who lives with his wife and daughter Sophia , one , in a £ 45million house in west London - married the heiress in a £ 7million wedding in France in July 2013 . The couple , who met in January 2013 and were engaged a month later , celebrated Sophia 's first birthday last month with a farmyard-themed party that cost an estimated £ 70,000 . This included ponies , a zebra , a balloon house and even a magical princess . And last year Sophia enjoyed a private visit from Father Christmas and a replica electric Bentley car toy . Miss Ecclestone 's family is worth an estimated £ 3billion - and the couple are said to own a £ 300,000 Ferrari , £ 123,000 Bentley GT Continental and a £ 100,000 Range Rover .

Company : Brigante Business Developments is based in this building -LRB- above -RRB- in Battersea , south-west London . A spokesman told The Sun yesterday : ` Although this company is still active it had not been trading in the financial year the filing reflects . ' Mr Rutland 's high-earning career in the City of London ended in shame in 2012 , when he was banned from trading over ` market abuse ' . In a damning ruling , the Financial Services Authority concluded he was not a ` fit and proper person ' and his behaviour demonstrated a lack of ` honesty and integrity ' . In 2013 Mr Rutland needed treatment for facial cuts after he was ambushed by two men in a mugging when he stopped his black Ferrari - just a month after marrying Miss Ecclestone . He was robbed of a £ 50,000 Rolex and a £ 20,000 bracelet by at least two thugs in an attack caught on CCTV , but the high-profile prosecution of a suspect was dropped due to insufficient evidence . MailOnline has approached a representative of the Ecclestone family for comment on the accounts .
