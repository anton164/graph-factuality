Tottenham head coach Mauricio Pochettino is unsure whether a planned boycott by Newcastle fans will prove a help or hindrance to his side this weekend . This season , like so many in recent years , has been a frustrating one at St James ' Park and that has led some fans to take action when Spurs arrive on Sunday . A number of supporters plan to boycott the televised game in protest against owner Mike Ashley , which is likely to lead to a peculiar atmosphere in the north east . Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino -LRB- right -RRB- is in an upbeat mood ahead of the trip to Newcastle . Newcastle fans are staging a mass protest against the current regime at St James ' Park . It will certainly make it an interesting test for Pochettino 's side as they look to recover from some disappointing recent results of their own . ` You never know because sometimes the effect on the players and team maybe is positive , ' the Spurs boss said . ` Maybe sometimes the players are scared and run more than all season . ` Or maybe it is a very negative atmosphere and they feel under pressure and do n't show their face . ` You never know in football how it can affect all the decisions around the team . For that it is difficult to guess what will happen on Sunday . ' On paper , this looks a good opportunity for Spurs to make amends for the goalless draw at Burnley and home defeat to Aston Villa . Christian Benteke scored the winner for Aston Villa to leave Spurs ' season in danger of fizzling out . The fact Pochettino 's predecessor Tim Sherwood oversaw the latter 's victory made it all the more frustrating , yet the Spurs boss was in a surprisingly upbeat mood ahead of the trip to St James ' Park . ` I think that football is football and I am a person who has spent all my life in football as player , manager and head coach , ' he said . ` I accept in football there are good and bad moments , but one thing important is to keep your balance and a good mood . ` We always want to win and we are ambitious , but always we need to have a very good mood . ` We need to have patience , we need to work hard , we have to have our minds on the players and we need to have very good energy to repeat some of the performances this season . ' Pochettino will come up against his countryman Jonas Guiterrez following his recovery from cancer . This weekend 's match against Newcastle will also see Pochettino come up against a countryman who has made many a headline of late . Former Argentina international Jonas Gutierrez 's recovery following a battle with cancer and his return to top-flight football has inspired many . ` I am very happy for him , ' Pochettino said . ` When he went in the game against Liverpool , he got a good ovation and it was good to see him playing football . ` This is real life . Sometimes we worry about a lot of things and results , but this is real life when you have the problems that he has . ` For me , I am very happy to see him come back to football . '
