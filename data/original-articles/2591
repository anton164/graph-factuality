Manchester United have put forward an opening £ 21.5 million offer for Dortmund captain Mats Hummels , according to German newspaper Bild . The Germans value their captain at £ 35million but in United 's favour he has had a relatively poor season occasionally clashing with supporters when results went against them earlier this season . Dortmund are keen to bring in Sami Khedira from Real Madrid as their new captain amid a summer of big changes following Jurgen Klopp 's announcement that he will leave the club at the end of the season . Manchester United are reported to have put in a £ 21.5 m bid for Dortmund defender Mats Hummels -LRB- left -RRB- . Hummels -LRB- left -RRB- struggled early in the season for Dortmund and United hope to use that to their advantage . German paper Bild have reported the bid has been placed but Sportsmail understands the offer has n't gone in yet . German World Cup winner Hummels is under contract with Dortmund until 2017 but earlier in the season admitted he would like to play abroad at some point in his career . He told Kicker : ` Some days I think I would definitely like to move abroad but then , other days , I think I do n't fancy it at all , ' he said when asked of United 's interest . ` Basically , I think moving abroad would be good for my professional and personal well-being . Eventually , I 'd like to leave the Bundesliga . ` I have had many conversations with the leaders of Dortmund , where I know I am a big part of the team , but I am yet to make a decision about my future . United also retain an interest in Hummels 's Dortmund team-mate Ilkay Gundogan , who the club see as a potential successor to Michael Carrick . Ilkay Gundogan -LRB- right -RRB- is also a target for United as they look to revamp their squad in the summer . Dortmund want to bring in Real Madrid 's Sami Khedira -LRB- right -RRB- as their new captain for next season .
