Twitter 's top lawyer has admitted it has been ` inexcusably slow ' in tackling online trolls who make the lives of others a misery . Vijaya Gadde said the social network had let internet abuse go ` unchecked ' because it did not recognise the scope and scale of the problem . Miss Gadde said Twitter had tripled the size of the team that deals with online abuse -- because it had to do better . She made the announcement on the day a study found that 88 per cent of abusive behaviour on social media happens on Twitter . Anti-bullying campaigners have also long complained that Twitter is a sanctuary for trolls who post hateful abuse behind the veil of anonymity . In an article for the Washington Post , Miss Gadde said that running Twitter required constant vigilance but that the company had ` failed to live up to ' this aim . She admitted that ` our response times have been inexcusably slow and the substance of our responses too meagre ' . Miss Gadde wrote : ` This is , to put it mildly , not good enough . ` Freedom of expression means little as our underlying philosophy if we continue to allow voices to be silenced because they are afraid to speak up . We need to do a better job combating abuse without chilling or silencing speech ' . Miss Gadde , general counsel for Twitter , said the extra staff the company had hired meant it was responding to five times as many complaints about abuse . The company was also making other changes ` in ways that wo n't be readily apparent ' to ensure its 284million users worldwide are safe .
