There 's nothing more exciting that when a whole league season comes down to the wire , with two or perhaps three teams still in contention right up to the last few weeks . But Sir Alex Ferguson 's favourite phrase for this scenario , ` squeaky bum time ' , does n't begin to cover the current situation in Algeria 's Championnat National de Premiere Division . With four rounds of matches remaining , just 11 points split leaders ES Setif and bottom-placed NA Hussein Dey , meaning , theoretically , that any of the 16 teams in the league could still be crowned champions . The current state of the Algerian League table , which sees all 16 teams in with a shout of the championship . Algerian football fans are in for an exciting - if incredibly tense - final few rounds of the season . The insanely tight league table means that a bad run for any of the teams in the top half could yet condemn them to relegation , while a series of wins for those near the bottom could yet propel them to glory . With 12 points left to play for , there is everything still to play for . The top two teams qualify for next year 's CAF Champions League , while the team in third make the CAF Confederation Cup , Africa 's equivalent of the Europa League . The Algerian League certainly has a claim to be the most exciting in the world at the moment . Three teams will be relegated to the second division and with the goal difference column all over the place , anything could happen yet . Last year 's champions USM Algier are currently in fifth place but are just four points off the top . To add to the suspense , the league now pauses for a month . And it goes without saying that the final day of the season on June 12 will be a tense affair .
