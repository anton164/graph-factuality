Sometimes a shrill alarm tone is n't enough to get you out of bed . And for one lazy dog , even a constant head-pounding could n't rouse her from sleep . Lori Smith filmed her pooch Boomer being repeatedly hit as she lay with her head resting on the ledge of her electronic dog door . With the door jammed , it is seen constantly moving up and down hitting her skull each time . ` She just sits here all day and does n't even care , ' Smith is heard saying as she watches the scene play out . ` That 's awful ! ' a man in the background adds . However , he ca n't help but giggle as he observes Boomer refusing to budge . After more than 20 seconds and numerous head taps , Boomer appears resting in the same position . One viewer said that perhaps the canine saw it as a type of head massage . Caught on camera : Lori Smith filmed her pooch Boomer being repeatedly hit as she lay with her head resting on the ledge of her electronic dog door . Nightmare : With the door jammed , it is seen constantly moving up and down hitting her skull each time .
