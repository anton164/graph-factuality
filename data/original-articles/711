The MCC has announced the latest phase of its ` Masterplan ' redevelopment of Lord 's which includes the replacement of the ` tired ' Tavern and Allen stands . The intention is to build a single new structure in their place , with more than 5,500 seats , in the south-western corner of the home of cricket - to raise the ground 's overall capacity to almost 30,000 . MCC is operating to a projected budget of £ 80million , and hopes work can begin in autumn 2017 - subject to planning permission , consultation with nearby residents and the approval of club members . MCC reveals plans to replace the ` tired ' Tavern and Allen stands at Lord 's , with completion scheduled for 2019 . The redevelopment will increase the overall capacity of Lord 's , the home of English cricket , to almost 30,000 . If the project goes ahead , a new Thomas Lord Building and new Tavern pub will also be included - as well as enlarged dressing rooms in the pavilion and a ` more pedestrian-friendly entrance to the ground ' , via the Grace Gates . MCC chief executive Derek Brewer said : ` The south-western project will ensure facilities for players , match officials , supporters and MCC members are of the highest possible standard by modernising areas of the ground that have become tired . ` MCC is committed to maintaining Lord 's as the finest cricket ground in the world , and this project also provides a wonderful new front door to the home of cricket . ' MCC aims to submit a planning application to Westminster City Council this summer . A completion schedule for the new stand is spring 2019 , in time for that summer 's World Cup and Ashes . It is anticipated the remaining elements of the ` Masterplan ' may take a further three years . The ` Masterplan ' , which has a projected budget of £ 80million , should be ready for the World Cup and Ashes .
