Saudi Arabian footballer Emad Sahabi suffered a gruesome broken ankle while playing for his club Al Orubah against Al Shoalah . The match came to halt on 19 minutes when the midfielder 's ankle appeared to have twisted 180 degrees after chasing down the ball - much to the horror of his team-mates . It seemed innocuous , as he tumbled over under pressure before his joint snapped and appeared to dislocate , leaving it hanging off the end of his leg . Emad Sahabi writhes in pain after suffering an horrific ankle break while playing for Al Orubah . Al Orubah went on to win the game 2-0 but the result was overshadowed by Sahabi 's horror injury . The break brings back the nightmare injuries suffered by Arsenal duo Eduardo and Aaron Ramsey a few years ago . Both men were out for over a year and it would appear Sahabi has a long road to recovery ahead of him . The midfielder suffered the injury while chasing a ball down after just 19 minutes into the game .
