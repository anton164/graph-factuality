They 're the fastest-growing nutrition bar in the U.S. with sales topping $ 100 million . But the FDA has ruled that KIND bars are not as kind on the body as they purport to be . Investigators found that a number of flavors were labeled ` healthy ' - brimming with fiber , protein and antioxidants , while being low in fat and sodium . However , upon closer inspection , it was found that ` none of the products met the requirements to make such content claims ' and were in fact ` misbranded ' . Mislabeled ? The FDA has ruled that KIND bars are not as kind on the body as they purport to be . Indeed , Daily Mail Online calculated that one KIND bar flavor - not included in the FDA investigation - contains more calories , fat and sodium than a Snickers bar . A 40g Honey Smoked BBQ KIND Bar - marketed as ` bold and all-natural ' - contains 230 calories , 16gms of fat and 125mgs of sodium . Meanwhile , an equivalent serving of Snickers contains 190 calories , 9gms of fat and 91mgs of sodium . In response , a spokesperson for KIND highlighted that nuts are to blame for the imbalance . ` Nuts , key ingredients in many of our snacks and one of the things that make fans love our bars , contain nutritious fats that exceed the amount allowed under the FDA 's standard . ` This is similar to other foods that do not meet the standard for use of the term healthy , but are generally considered to be good for you like avocados , salmon and eggs . ' . However , New York University nutritionist Marion Nestle told Today.com that said the problem is not nuts and it 's the ` hidden ' sugary ingredients that have to change . KIND Bar : Honey Smoked BBQ -LRB- 40g -RRB- . Calories : 230 . Fat : 16gm . Sodium : 125 mg . Protein : 10g . Snickers Bar -LRB- 40g -RRB- . Calories : 190 . Fat : 9gm . Sodium : 91 mg . Protein : 3g . ` KIND bars are candy bars making health claims , and thereby marketing them as healthy snacks , ' Nestle said . The four KIND bars highlighted in the FDA case include the Almond & Apricot , Almond & Coconut , Peanut Butter Dark Chocolate and Dark Chocolate Cherry Cashew . On April 14 KIND posted a note on its website stating that it was ` moving quickly to comply ' with the FDA 's request . ` We 're also taking it upon ourselves to conduct a thorough review of all of our snack food labels and website information to ensure that they 're compliant , ' the message continued . While labeling readjustments will be made to certain bars , KIND reassures fans that recipes will remain the same . It added : ` We could n't be more proud of our snack foods and their nutritional benefits . ` Our entire line of delicious snacks made with high quality ingredients like whole grains , nuts and seeds will continue to be available wherever KIND is sold . ' KIND bars , the brainchild of New York salesman Daniel Lubetzky , first hit the market in 2004 . The clear-packaged snacks quickly became a hit with consumers and sales soared from $ 15 million in 2008 to nearly $ 120 million in 2012 , according to Fortune . In a bid to expand into the health food market further , Lubetzky came up with a granola-like cereal called ` healthy grain clusters ' . . There 's said to be ` a multitude of new recipes ' in the pipeline too .
