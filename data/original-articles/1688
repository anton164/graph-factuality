Britain 's Adam Peaty has broken the men 's 100 metres breast stroke world record with a time of 57.92 seconds at the London Aquatic Centre . The 20-year-old from Uttoxeter 's gold-winning time on Friday beat the previous record of 58.46 set by South African Cameron van der Burgh in the same venue at the 2012 Olympics . A tweet from British Swimming 's account read : ` WORLD RECORD time for @adam - peaty he hits the wall in 57.92 !!!! ' British swimmer Adam Peaty is all smiles after setting a new world record for the 100m breast stroke . His time of 57.92 seconds has beaten the previous record of 58.46 set by Cameron van der Burgh in 2012 . Peaty has spoken of his delight that his hard work and training have paid off and is thrilled with the win . After becoming the first man in history to break through the 58-second barrier in the discipline , Peaty said : ` I ca n't believe it , coming in earlier I thought I could get a really good time , maybe a 58.5 . ` Before that race I just thought I 've done all the training for a 57 , and it all paid off in the end . ` The crowd were great and they really carried me home at the end , because that was a hell of a pain train . There must be something in that lane four when it really matters . ' Scotland 's Ross Murdoch fought hard but was left trailing in Peaty 's wake with a time of 59.12 - still inside the World Championship qualification standard - while James Wilby of Loughborough took bronze with a 1:00.31 . Ben Proud topped the podium in the men 's 50m freestyle by coming home in 21.99 , with his fellow Plymouth swimmer Thomas Fannon taking silver in 22.48 from Andrew Weatheritt -LRB- 22.50 -RRB- . In the women 's competition , Fran Halsall stormed to victory in the open 50m freestyle . The 25-year-old claimed her 10th consecutive title with a time of 24.37 and said afterwards : ` It 's pretty good to be able to come in 10 years in a row and be the best in Britain . ` I did n't have the ideal preparation coming into this meet , I got sent home from the World Championships in December and it took a lot longer than expected to get back into full training . ` Last year I went a 24.5 at this meet then on to a 23.9 in the summer , so to come here and already be two tenths up on that is a great sign . ' Lauren Quigley of Stockport Metro hit 25.22 for silver ahead of Rebecca Guy , who clocked in at 25.49 . In the morning Rachael Kelly had defended her British Championship title with a time of 57.72 in the open 100m butterfly final . Jemma Lowe -LRB- 58.07 -RRB- collected silver with Bath team-mate Siobhan-Marie O'Connor third thanks to a 58.37 . -LRB- Left to right -RRB- : Thomas Fannon , Ben Proud and Andrew Weatheritt poses with their medals on the podium .
