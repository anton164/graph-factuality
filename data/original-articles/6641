Paul Smith has landed one of the toughest fights in boxing after finalising terms to face Andre Ward on June 20 . As revealed by Sportsmail , the fight in Oakland , California will not be for Ward 's WBA super-middleweight world title . But it amounts to a huge , albeit daunting , opportunity for Smith , who failed in back-to-back challenges for Arthur Abraham 's WBO belt . Paul Smith -LRB- left -RRB- has landed a shot at the unbeaten Californian Andre Ward . Ward -LRB- right -RRB- has not fought since he beat Edwin Rodriguez on points in November 2013 . In Ward he will face a man who outclassed Carl Froch in 2011 , but who has been inactive since November 2013 . Ring rust from that 17-month spell could be a factor in determining if Smith can beat one of the sport 's top pound-for-pound talents , with the 32-year-old saying : ` I can not wait to get back in the ring and test myself against a class act like Andre Ward . ` I proved that I belong at the top level with my performances against Arthur Abraham and this is a challenge that I am relishing . Andre is a top pound-for-pound fighter and someone I respect a lot , but he has only boxed once in almost three years and I will give it everything I have got . ` I am fresh and confident going into this fight . It 's a massive opportunity for me and one that I took with both hands when it was offered . I have spent a lot of time boxing in the United States and I look forward to returning for this fight . ' Ward said : ` I 'm very excited to be coming back on June 20 at Oracle Arena in my hometown of Oakland , which has been a long time coming . I have an extremely tough fighter in front of me in Paul Smith , who 's looking to pull the upset , but I ca n't let that happen . ` I have to be on my best game to turn Smith away and beat him the way I want to beat him . ' Ward 's WBA world super-middleweight title will not be on the line when he faces Smith in June .
