Borussia Dortmund defender Mats Hummels is leaving his options open amid speculation he may leave the club in the summer as he admits he is contemplating leaving the club . The German centre-back gave an interview in Kicker magazine last week in which he demanded a stronger Dortmund team for next season , otherwise he may consider his own future . The Westphalians seem certain to miss out on a place in the Champions League next season while they may not even qualify for the Europa League , and Hummels has admitted again he may not be sticking with the club for much longer . Mats Hummels has admitted he is considering his future at Borussia Dortmund . The Germany defender has consistently been linked with a big-money move to Manchester United . ` That does n't mean that I am leaving , it just means I 'm reflecting , ' he told Sky television following a 1-0 defeat to Bayern Munich at the weekend . ` There 's no particular tendency one way or the other . It 's just thoughts going through my mind . It will all become clearer in the coming weeks . ' In 2007 , when he moved to Dortmund from Bayern , he turned down an approach from Hoffenheim and said that was a ` gut feeling ' . Hummels closes down Mario Gotze during Dortmund 's 1-0 defeat by Bayern Munich on Saturday . ` It 's going to be the same again this time , ' added the 26-year-old , who still has two years left to run on his contract with Dortmund , but has already attracted attention from several other clubs around Europe . Manchester United were reportedly willing to offer up to Â£ 30million for his services - an amount Dortmund may struggle to reject if they can not count on earning that sort of money from the Champions League next season .
