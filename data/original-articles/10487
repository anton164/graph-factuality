Nottingham Forest will make a renewed move for Blackburn 's £ 10million-rated striker Jordan Rhodes this summer . Forest manager Dougie Freedman failed in a bid to sign the 25-year-old on loan with view to a permanent deal in March as Blackburn rebuffed interest from Forest , Derby , Norwich and Middlesbrough . Freedman though now hopes the offer of straight cash can tempt Rovers into parting with a forward who has scored 70 goals in the last three seasons . Nottingham Forest are keen on signing Blackburn striker Jordan Rhodes , but it could cost them £ 10m . Rhodes has scored 70 goals in the last three seasons , and Blackburn have so far resisted all bids for him . Blackburn manager Gary Bowyer expects further interest in Rhodes ' strike partner Rudy Gestede too after seeing the Benin international boost his season 's tally to 19 goals against Forest on Saturday . Hull , Crystal Palace , West Brom and Southampton have all watched French-born Gestede and Bowyer said : ` I know there 's going to be interest in him . '
