If Bale 's goal had dented Granada 's fragile defence , Ronaldo was about to crush it into one of those breakers ' yard scrap metal cubes with three quick goals that ended the match as a contest before the break . On the half hour he took a pass from James Rodriguez -- back in action after 60 days out with a broken toe -- and found Oier 's far corner . Six minutes later Ronaldo played the ball out to Marcelo and when Oier parried the full-back 's cross the Portuguese was on the spot to sweep it home . And two minutes after that he completed his hat-trick from Bale 's pass . The Welsman 's ball found him in space down the left . Rodriguez made a run on the outside and as the defenders were dragged one way , Ronaldo dropped his shoulder the other and beat Oier who could only flap at the ball as it whooshed past him . Granada came into the game having only won once at the Bernabeu back in 1974 -- this clearly was not going to be the second win here in their history . Not that they had not had chances to score themselves in the first half . When the score was still 0-0 Iker Casillas threw the ball straight to Robert Ibanez but the Granada winger sent his shot straight back at the Spain goalkeeper who was whistled by home supporters for his sloppy distribution . Their next chance came when they were already four down with El Arabi 's shot crashing down off the underside of Casillas bar and spinning to safety just before half-time . It did not spark a second half revival . Benzema scored goal number five , five minutes into the second half criminally given time to bring the ball down on his chest after a Rodriguez corner .

He went close with a header and Ronaldo shot wide from another Bale assist as Real looked for more goals . Granada made it 7-1 with Iba√±ez getting away from Arbeloa and sliding the ball beneath Casillas . But the seven goal defecit was restored when Mainz put past his own keeper , converting a Modric cross for fear the ball would reach Ronaldo lurking at the back post hoping to score his fifth of the game . It did n't stop him getting his fifth of the game right on full-time . Again it was a Modric cross and this time no-one prevented it reaching Ronaldo who headed in his 37th league goal of the season to make it 9-1 . Three minutes later Bale selfishly set-up Ronaldo for his fourth goal of the afternoon after receiving Marcelo 's pass .
