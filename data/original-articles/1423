March was an impressive month for Arsene Wenger and Arsenal as four Premier League wins from four cemented their place in the Champions League places . And the Frenchman 's reward for their good form was another Manager of the Month accolade to sit on his mantelpiece . Wenger has quite a few of the gongs now - 14 to be exact - but he has quite a long way to run until he matches the 27 monthly prizes of Sir Alex Ferguson . Arsene Wenger is March 's winner of the Premier League Manager of the Month award - his 14th accolade . Wenger with the Manager of the Month Award for April 2002 - when his Arsenal team won the league title . A grey-suited Wenger with his award from October 2000 - one of 14 he has won at Arsenal . Wenger 's Manager of the Month award for March 1998 was delivered in an Easter egg . 75 - England . 52 - Scotland . 17 - France . 12 - Northern Ireland . 9 - Italy . 7 - Ireland , Spain . 5 - Portugal . 4 - Wales . 3 - Chile , Holland . 1 - Argentina , Israel , Sweden . The legendary Manchester United manager was the inaugural winner of the Manager of the Month award when it was introduced in August 1993 , at the start of the Premier League 's second season . With United winning no fewer than 12 Premier League titles during that time , it comes as little surprise to see the Scot top of the list . In the 1999-2000 campaign , he won it in August , March and April as United romped to the title by 18 points and exerted a similar dominance in 2006-2007 , claiming the prize in August , October and February . The last of Ferguson 's 27 awards came in October 2012 , not long before he announced his retirement . A Manchester United double as Alex Ferguson and Eric Cantona celebrate their awards in 1996 . Ferguson won 27 monthly prizes in all , including this one for February 1997 . Ferguson and Wayne Rooney were celebrating in February 2005 as they claimed the monthly prizes . Wenger first got his hands on the award in March 1998 and also won it the following month as Arsenal claimed the Double of Premier League and FA Cup in his first full campaign . Before this month 's win , Wenger had last been recognised in September 2013 as his team made a positive start in a campaign that would ultimately see them finish fourth . He may have struggled to fill Ferguson 's shoes at Old Trafford , but David Moyes won this accolade 10 times when in charge of Everton . Harry Redknapp and Martin O'Neill have the monthly award listed eight times on their CVs , while Bobby Robson , Rafa Benitez and Sam Allardyce both have six . Jose Mourinho may have led Chelsea to two Premier League titles but his tally of three is not as many as the four won by Joe Kinnear during his days as Wimbledon manager . 27 - Manchester United . 14 - Arsenal , Liverpool . 13 - Newcastle United . 12 - Everton . 11 - Chelsea . 9 - Manchester City , Southampton . 8 - Tottenham Hotspur . 7 - Aston Villa , Bolton Wanderers . 6 - Blackburn Rovers . 5 - Leeds United , West Ham United . 4 - Leicester City , Wimbledon . 3 - Charlton Athletic , Coventry City , Middlesbrough , Nottingham Forest , Portsmouth , Reading , Sheffield Wednesday , Sunderland , West Bromwich Albion , Wigan Athletic . 2 - Fulham , Swansea City . 1 - Birmingham City , Crystal Palace , Derby County , Hull City , Ipswich Town , Norwich City , Oldham Athletic , Queens Park Rangers . The Manager of the Month trophy made a nice desk ornament for Everton 's David Moyes in September 2004 . Bolton 's start to the 2001-02 season earned Sam Allardyce the Manager of the Month prize . Harry Redknapp , then at Southampton , receives the March 2005 award from his son Jamie . Aston Villa boss Martin O'Neill shows off his Manager of the Month award for April 2007 . Jose Mourinho has won the prize on three occasions - including here in March 2007 . But ` The Special One ' has n't cleaned up as much as former Wimbledon boss Joe Kinnear -LRB- left -RRB- , who won four . Remarkably , Kinnear was manager of the month in September 1993 , March 1994 and then April 1994 as his team finished sixth before a final award in Septmber 1996 . Given Ferguson 's dominance , it comes as little surprise that Manchester United come out on top in the clubs list . Wenger 's win this month means Arsenal now have 14 overall , the same as Liverpool . Newcastle United are n't far behind with 13 , followed by Everton on 12 and Chelsea on 11 . English managers dominate the list looking back , with 75 managers from this country having won the prize . The award has been won 52 times by a Scottish manager and 17 times by a Frenchman .
