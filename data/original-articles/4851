Russell said : ` Liam is so disappointed not to be coming but he has picked up a shoulder injury . He has just had a really intense play-off series and his injury means he will not be able to travel . ` It is a shame for the lad but I am sure his time will come again in the future . It means a place now for Craig Peacock , who was unlucky to be left out of the original 23-man squad . ` Craig is a highly-talented player and it was a hard decision for me to leave him out in the first place . I am sure Craig will prove me wrong that I should not have left him out . '
