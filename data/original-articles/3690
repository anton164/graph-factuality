It 's crunch time this weekend at the top of the Premier League as second-placed Arsenal host table toppers Chelsea - and it appears one star of the former 's team can not wait for the ever-nearing kick-off . Arsenal playmaker Mesut Ozil can now countdown the minutes until the 4 pm encounter on Sunday with his brand new Apple Watch . The 26-year-old was the beneficiary of the timepiece - which ranges in price from £ 299 to £ 13,500 - as he visited an Apple store on Thursday afternoon . Arsenal midfielder Mesut Ozil -LRB- right -RRB- took to Instagram to show off his new Apple Watch on Thursday . Ozil compared his watch to TV character Michael Knight in the hit action show Knight Rider . Ozil took to Instagram to share his joy at his latest gift , comparing his gadget to former TV character Michael Knight from the hit action show Knight Rider . Accompanied with the caption : ` Excited about my new cool gadget ! It 's just like Michael Knight 's watch , but a real one #knightrider #phone , ' Ozil appears in awe of the device - which will be released on general sale on Friday . The midfielder , who has scored four goals in 25 matches for the Gunners in all competitions this season , is expected to start for Arsene Wenger 's side at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday . Arsenal trail the Blues by 10 points with six league games remaining - but have been boosted by the return of Jack Wilshere . Wilshere was on the bench in their FA Cup semi-final win over Reading at Wembley on April 18 after five months out through injury . And club legend Ray Parlour believes that the 23-year-old 's fitness record is the one thing holding him back from reaching his undoubted potential in the Arsenal midfield . ` I think he 's the future of the club , ' said Parlour . ` I think if he stays fit , he 's a quality player , there 's no doubt about that . Jack Wilshere -LRB- centre -RRB- was on the bench for Arsenal 's FA Cup semi-final against Reading . Ray Parlour , who won three championships with Arsenal , has backed Wilshere to be the future of the club . ` The way he goes past players , the way he links up with people , I definitely think he 's got a big role to play . ` But again , the big question mark is can he stay fit ? Look at Abou Diaby . Diaby 's a terrific player . But look at him , the injuries the last few years . ` The big burning question is can Wilshere have a full season without being injured for a long period , like he has n't had for the last three or four seasons . ' Wilshere , the England international , is pictured in training for Arsenal at London Colney last week .
