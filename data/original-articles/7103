Zara Phillips saw her hopes of success at the Rolex Kentucky three-day event disappear in frustrating fashion on Friday . Phillips had travelled to the United States with her London 2012 and 2014 World Equestrian Games Great Britain team silver medal-winning ride High Kingdom . But Phillips , The Queen 's granddaughter , withdrew before her scheduled dressage test at Kentucky Horse Park . Zara Phillips has had to pull out of the Kentucky three-day event after High Kingdom suffered an injury . Phillips won silver in the team Equestrian section of the Eventing at London 2012 on board High Kingdom . The horse was being tacked up in his stable ahead of its early evening test , UK time , when he kicked out and suffered a cut leg . High Kingdom was then taken to the dressage warm-up area , but the decision was taken to withdraw him in the horse 's best interests . Kentucky is the first of this year 's major competitions and Phillips had aimed high with High Kingdom there , although the horse is also entered for the Mitsubishi Motors Badminton Horse Trials , which begin on May 7 . Phillips , 33 , was due to make her debut in the Kentucky competition , which is one of six global four-star events along with Badminton , Burghley , Luhmuhlen in Germany , Pau and Adelaide . PHillips , The Queen 's granddaughter , was due to make her Kentucky debut , but will now miss out . Great Britain eventing team boss Yogi Breisner , who is in Kentucky , has not ruled out the possibility of High Kingdom featuring at Badminton , depending on how the horse recovers and following a long flight home . `` High Kingdom unfortunately had a kick in the stables and cut himself , which led to him being withdrawn , '' he told Press Association Sport . `` He is still entered at Badminton , so we will see how he is when he gets back to the UK .
