The BBC faced angry criticism last night for giving an Election platform to a ` mini Russell Brand ' who has mocked David Cameron over his disabled son . Self-styled ` angry Leftie revolutionary and magician ' Gareth Shoulder , from Liverpool , has been recruited by the BBC to comment on the Election as a member of its ` Generation 2015 Election youth panel ' . Shoulder , 24 , who is a big fan of Brand and regularly messages the comedian on social media , used his ` @bbcgen2015 ' Twitter page to make the disparaging remark about Mr Cameron and Ivan , who died aged six in 2009 after being born with cerebral palsy and epilepsy . After Mr Cameron spoke movingly in the first leaders TV Election debate about the NHS care given to Ivan , Shoulder sneered : ` A new record for Cameron ... 34 minutes before he pulls out the Ivan card and pretends he cares about our NHS . ' Shoulder also said that , in the debate , the Prime Minister had ` really annoyed ' him and made him want to tear politicians ` a new one ' -- a shorthand reference to an extremely offensive phrase . Following Thursday 's TV Election debate , Shoulder then imagined the three female party leaders taking part -- SNP 's Nicola Sturgeon , Plaid Cymru 's Leanne Woods and the Green Party 's Natalie Bennett -- to be the subjects of a lewd parlour game , tweeting : ` Bennett , Sturgeon , Woods . **** , marry , avoid . ' He also called Chancellor Osborne a ` briefcase w **** r ' . The BBC says it ` hand-picked ' its 200-strong Generation 2015 youth panel to ` address fundamental questions about the relationship between UK young adults and democracy ' . The 24-year-old used his ` @bbcgen2015 ' Twitter page to make the disparaging remark about Mr Cameron and Ivan , who died aged six in 2009 after being born with cerebral palsy and epilepsy . Mr Cameron is pictured with his wife Samantha and children , Ivan , Nancy and Elwen , near his Oxfordshire home in 2009 . Last night Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said : ` It is disgraceful that the BBC should give a platform to someone to spew such Left-wing bile . ' Mr Shoulder said : ` Speak to the BBC , ' and refused to comment further . A BBC spokesman said that Mr Shoulder was speaking in his own capacity , not as a representative of the BBC .
