Singer Adele Adkins , a mother-of-one , has topped the young music rich list again , earning £ 5million in the last year , despite releasing no new music .

Adele has amassed twice the wealth of her nearest competitors , the four remaining members of One Direction , plus recently departed Zayn Malik , who are worth £ 25million each . ` I am a singer . I will stick to what I am good at and not spread myself thin and become mediocre at everything I do .
