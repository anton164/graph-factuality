Scroll down for video . Sucker punch : A wallaby shocked on lookers as he ` punched ' a wombat who approached him while he was grazing . In a performance you would expect from a boxing kangaroo , the wallaby turned around and gave the wombat a little crack on the nose after it seemingly got a little too close for comfort . Onlookers were shocked by the actions of the wallaby but it looks like there 's no bad blood between the two native Australian 's as they both continued happily grazing in the area straight after the encounter . The wombat had no idea what he was in for as he approached the unsuspecting wallaby . Unlike this encounter , wallabies typically use their strong hind legs to deliver a powerful kick when they are feeling threatened . Wilsons Promontory National Park is home to a range of wildlife including kangaroos , emus , echidnas and numerous other smaller marsupials . The wildlife there has become quite accustomed to human presence and animals will often approach people or enter tents looking for food . Make sure you remember that it 's illegal to feed wildlife in the national park and if you 're caught could be slapped with a fine by park rangers .
