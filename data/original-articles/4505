Fully charged : The new scheme will let EE customers pick up free portable chargers . The UK 's biggest mobile network has announced details of a scheme to help customers keep their mobile phones charged . EE shops are planning to give away free portable chargers so that people can revive their phones wherever they are . Once the EE ` power bar ' runs down , customers will be able to swap it for a new one at any EE shop , or spend four hours charging it up themselves at home . The chargers will be free to EE customers , and other smartphone owners can also sign up to the service if they pay a Â£ 20 fee . EE said that battery-draining video streaming and social media site browsing now accounted for more than 50 per cent of all data use on their network . Its research found that almost 60 per cent of smartphone users found their battery would not last a full day . And over half said they wish there were more ways to charge their phone in public places -- rising to over 70 per cent of 18 to 24-year-olds . The firm 's marketing officer , Pippa Dunn , said : ` Almost everyone 's experienced the frustration associated with running out of battery , it seems to happen when you need your phone the most . ` We 're giving customers a power bar that can be swapped for a fully charged one at any of our stores , at any time , for free .
