Maverick Tottenham forward Emmanuel Adebayor has insisted that he is happy to stay and fight for his place at White Hart Lane and rejected reports linking him with a move away . Taking to Twitter on Tuesday night , the 31-year-old Togo international expressed his gratitude at being able to play in the Premier League and labeled the division ` the best in the world . ' Adebayor joined Spurs in 2011 from Manchester City , initially on loan before an impressive first season tally of 18 goals , convinced the club to make the switch permanent for Â£ 5million the following summer . Tottenham striker Emmanuel Adebayor rides the challenge of Liverpool defender Dejan Lovren -LRB- left -RRB- . Adebayor takes to Twitter to pledge his future to Tottenham and insists he will fight for his place in the team . Adebayor gives an underwhelming performance against League One side Sheffield United in the League Cup . The striker 's significantly more modest form since then , however , coupled with the meteoric rise of homegrown star Harry Kane , have left Adebayor little more than a bit-part in the Spurs machine . This season , he has made just 16 appearances in all competitions , scoring only twice and has been criticised for several underwhelming performances , in particular his showing against League One 's Sheffield United in the Capital One Cup semi-final . Yet , the former Arsenal , Real Madrid and Manchester City hitman remains adamant that he will see out the remainder of his contract in north London . Adebayor 's last Premier League goal for Spurs came during a 1-2 defeat by Newcastle back in October last year . Adebayor has made just 10 appearances in all competitions this season and scored only twice . Adebayor might be deemed surplus to requirements due to the breakthrough of homegrown star Harry Kane .
