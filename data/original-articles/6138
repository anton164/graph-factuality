Mrs Kebede has been married to Ethiopian hedge fund manager Kassy Kebede for 15 years , and has two children with him , Suhul , 14 , and Raee , ten .

Earlier this year , The Fashion Spot assessed 44 major print publications across the globe to determine which magazines did and did not feature models from a minority background on their cover at some point in 2014 . American Vogue featured more black cover stars in 2014 than it ever has before in a single year , including Rihanna in March -LRB- right -RRB- and Lupita Nyong ' o in July -LRB- left -RRB- . According to The Fashion Spot , white models were chosen as cover stars nearly five times as often as non-white women -LRB- pictured -RRB- . White models were found to appear 567 times out of 611 total covers , while people of colour made the cut just 119 times , nearly five times less overall . Harper 's Bazaar U.S. and UK , Vogue UK , Vogue Netherlands , Vogue Paris , Vogue Ukraine , Vogue Russia , Teen Vogue , Num√©ro , LOVE and Porter all failed to use a single woman of minority on their covers at all in 2014 . Only time will tell whether Vogue will continue to lead the way in including a wider range of ethnicities on its covers in 2015 , and whether the rest of the fashion world will follow .
