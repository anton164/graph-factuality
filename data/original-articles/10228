Children are known to copy the actions of their parents . And one adorable little girl has mastered a brilliant impression of her pregnant mother . Captured in a 15-second clip , the youngster emulates the way her pregnant mother walks - and the result is hilarious . The 15-month-old girl arches her back and pushes out her belly while strutting around the room . The youngster pulls a cheeky face while her father also mimics the mum 's pregnant walk in the background . The clip begins with mum , American Teri O'Neil , 30 , asking 15-month-old Olivia : ` How does mama walk ? ' while filming at her home . Suddenly the youngster appears from the side of the shot and with her back bent and tummy pushed forward she struts past . She pulls a cheeky face as she continues around the room -- in the background her father can be seen emulating the walk with her . The video concludes with Olivia briefly interacting with the dog , who jumps out of the way , and walking towards the camera with a beaming smile . According to Teri , she recorded the video when she was six months pregnant with her son Liam . The mother of two writes about her children on her blog and has documented everything from their birth stories to the everyday things they get up to . She also uploads numerous videos to her YouTube channel , which shows the youngsters taking their first steps and of course , imitating her . The young girl briefly interacts with the dog before turning towards the camera with a big smile on her face .
