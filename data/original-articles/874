This is the incredible moment a tiger was sent crashing to the floor after mistiming an attack on a fleet-footed bird . The ferocious feline was chasing what was sure to be dinner when it slipped on the icy surface and lost its footing . As the tiger raced towards the bird , it flew directly upwards forcing the mammal to try and stop dead in its tracks . Oops-a-daisy ! This tiger lots its footing in spectacular style while trying to catch a chicken at a zoo in China . On the attack : At first all was well , with the tiger homing straight in on an airborne feathery meal . Target : As the bird flew upwards the tiger began to rear up , ready to grab its prey from the air . Fail : The tiger began to slip as the bird flew higher and higher in a blind panic - and it was all caught on camera by photographer Libby Zhang . Hang time : The slip caused the tiger to flip right onto its back , with the bird now well out of reach . But momentum caused its feet to slide away from underneath and go skidding along the slippery ground . The hilarious moment took place at the Hengdaohezi Siberian Tiger Park in Northeast China and was captured by photographer Libby Zhang . Libby , from Houston in Texas , was visiting the park and photographing the tigers ' feeding session . Love your tiger feet : The hilarious moment took place at the Hengdaohezi Siberian Tiger Park in Northeast China . Roaringly funny : The photographer said that a watching crowd burst out laughing when the tiger fell over . She said : ` The crowd burst out in a roar of laughter - it was during feeding time and several chickens were tossed at the tigers . ` One tiger tried to reach it but he lost his balance on the slippery icy and fell backwards . ` I was surprised to see the tiger slip and raised my camera in a hurry with rapid fires on the trigger . ` I wanted to capture the beauty and power of tigers in the same image , but this tiger slip series was a total surprise and added bonus for my trip .
