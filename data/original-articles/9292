Rodgers ' future at Anfield has been questioned after a third straight season without a trophy , but the former Liverpool defender backed the Reds manager . Speaking after collecting a Beacon Award for his community work on Merseyside on Tuesday , Carragher said : ` I do n't think your whole future should be determined by one game .

' Liverpool are seven points behind fourth placed Manchester City with a game in hand and look set to miss out on Champions League qualification for next season . Carragher added : ` Brendan , the players and the staff will be looking to next season and thinking they will go one step further , winning a trophy maybe and getting back into the top four . ` That 's his job . He has to identify where in the team they need to improve ; the squad is there and they did a lot of that last summer . Brendan Rodgers is under pressure at Liverpool after a third straight season without a trophy . Liverpool were knocked out of the FA Cup by Aston Villa in a disappointing semi-final performance . ` The signings have to be right , and if they are it will make a massive difference . If they 're not they 'll be back to where they are this season . ' Carragher received a Beacon Award at a ceremony in London on Tuesday night for his community work on Merseyside . The 37-year-old , who played 737 games for Liverpool , has provided coaching in eight schools in deprived areas of Merseyside through his 23 Foundation . Carragher , pictured at the 26th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster , backed Rodgers to stay at Anfield . The former Liverpool defender added : ` I hope that I can give youngsters a lift and that extra push to realise their goals . Liverpool is a place that likes to see its own do well . It is a tight-knit community and growing up I got a lot of help and encouragement from people around me . ` I 'm from an under-privileged area -- Bootle in Liverpool . If I ever got the chance to help that area and the wider community I 've always felt I would . ` There are plenty of philanthropists around the world who do great work and I am one of the many trying to do my little bit that will hopefully help people in my area .
