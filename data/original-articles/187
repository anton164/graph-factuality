That equates to almost two years of his life . 2 He loses between 2-4lb per session . In his 25-year amateur and professional career , he has lost the equivalent weight of two African elephants -- the heaviest animal on Earth . 3 McCoy has chipped 14 teeth and broken 13 bones in his quest to be the best . 4 Whilst most involved in horse racing have a history with the sport , McCoy did not begin to work around horses until he was 13 -- turning full-time at 15 when he left school . McCoy got a kiss from wife Chanelle after winning on Uxizandre at this year 's Cheltenham Festival . This graphic shows how much of a battering McCoy has taken over the years . A look at how McCoy 's dominance of his sport compares with other heavyweights of their trade . A lot has happened in the 20 years McCoy has been the champion jockey . 5 After time off following a broken leg , McCoy 's weight increased and resulted in him switching from flat racing to jumps racing . 6 McCoy has been Champion Jockey for 1,040 weeks whilst Roger Federer 's two spells at world No 1 equate to 302 weeks . Tiger Woods has spent 545 weeks as golf 's world No 1 . 7 McCoy says he has fallen off a horse more than 1,000 times , which is equivalent to falling from the world 's largest building , the Burj Khalifa , twice . 8 After the running of the 2010 Grand National , which AP won aboard Do n't Push It , bookmakers reported a loss of around £ 50million . 9 AP 's breakfast consists of a cup of tea with two sugars and maybe a piece of toast , if he is n't watching his weight too carefully for a ride later in the day . 10 In another move to control his weight , AP only eats four dinners per week . McCoy 's memorable wins . Do n't Push It - John Smith 's Grand National -LRB- April 10 , 2010 -RRB- . It was the race that had evaded McCoy for 14 years . In the past , he had been unseated , his horse had fallen , he had pulled up and was even forced out by a loose horse when in front one year . Yet , in true McCoy fashion , he never gave up hope of winning the world 's greatest race and at the 15th attempt , he took home the prize aboard Jonjo O'Neill 's Do n't Push It . With two fences remaining , McCoy laid down his challenge , edged ahead at the last and then drove clear to give racing one of its most famous wins . Video Courtesy of www.racinguk.com . Wichita Lineman - William Hill Trophy -LRB- March 10 , 2009 -RRB- . Never has a ride epitomised a jockey more than when McCoy dragged the 5-1 favourite past half the field to land the spoils in the final strides after a series of jumping mistakes . Having jumped the third last , Maljimar cruised into the lead and looked the likely winner , but McCoy refused to be beaten and forced a final rally from his tough partner to get up on the line and win by a neck .

Having won his first Gold Cup on Mr Mulligan in 1997 , it would be 15 years before McCoy tasted success again in Cheltenham 's blue riband race . He had to see off strong competition in the form of defending champion Long Run and two-time winner Kauto Star to do so . A mistake at the first fence saw Synchronised outpaced for much of the race , but McCoy timed his run to perfection and made sure Synchronised legendary stamina paid in the final run in up The Hill .

McCoy 's one and only Queen Mother Champion Chase title came courtesy of Edredon Blue , a horse on which he had won the Grand Annual two years previously . Having jumped the first fence at the front of the pack , McCoy led Edredon Bleu through an exhibition of fine jumping but had to show his trademark tenacity to repel Direct Route and Flagship Uberalles in an amazing three-way finish up The Hill . McCoy and his willing partner won it on the nod in one of the greatest Festival finishes of all time . Video Courtesy of www.racinguk.com . Mr Mulligan - Cheltenham Gold Cup -LRB- March 13 , 1997 -RRB- . McCoy 's first Cheltenham Gold Cup was won in some style on a 20-1 shot and at the age of just 22 . Prominent throughout , he led after 13 fences and never looked back to win by nine lengths in just his second season as a professional . Video Courtesy of www.racinguk.com . Brave Inca - Champion Hurdle -LRB- March 14 , 2006 -RRB- . Brave Inca is often described as an equine version of his famous jockey who showed the same grit and determination to hold off the challenges of Macs Joy and two-time defending champion Hardy Eustace . That Barry Cash and Ruby Walsh both came up short in the preceding and following years respectively showed that McCoy and Brave Inca were one of those partnerships which just got along . Video Courtesy of www.racinguk.com . Make A Stand - Champion Hurdle -LRB- March 11 , 1997 -RRB- . Make A Stand had won four races in succession , including the ultra-competitive Tote Gold Trophy by nine lengths , when he turned up to Cheltenham in 1997 for the Champion Hurdle . Despite his record , he was sent off only fifth favourite . Oliver Sherwood 's Large Action and Jim Old 's Collier Bay headed the market , while Irish raiders I 'm Supposin and Space Trucker were close in behind . None of them got a look in . McCoy sent Make A Stand to the front , and the duo were never headed . Three flights from home they were clear , and Make A stand galloped up the Cheltenham hill to win by five lengths .
