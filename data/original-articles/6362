Rafa Nadal got his clay court season off to a perfect , confidence-boosting start with a 6-2 , 6-1 win over Frenchman Lucas Pouille in the Monte Carlo Masters . It was a businesslike display from the world No 5 . He did n't unleash the full power of his forehand but played sensible , measured tennis and made only five unforced errors in the match . His talented 21-year-old opponent showed flashes of attacking flair , including one outrageous half-volley forehand winner , but was never able to put enough balls in court to trouble the great Spaniard . Rafael Nadal safely made his way into third round of the Monte Carlo Masters with win against Lucas Pouille . Nadal got his clay court season off to the perfect start with a straight sets victory 6-2 , 6-1 . Nadal broke in the sixth game of the match to go 4-2 up , and a shanked backhand from the world No 108 handed him another break and the first set . The nine-time French Open winner began the second set in the same steady form and broke Pouille twice to serve for the match at 5-1 . He arrowed a vintage forehand down the line to seal a place in the third round , where he will face either John Isner or Viktor Troicki . The Spaniard is an eight-time champion in Monte Carlo , but has not won here since 2012 and said last week that he is ` not the favourite for anything ' at the moment . Frenchman Pouille showed glimpses of his talent but was unable to trouble Nadal . Nadal is an eight-time champion at Monte Carlo but has n't won the tournament since 2012 . This victory was the first step in rebuilding his self-belief after disappointing losses in the quarter-finals of the Indian Wells Masters and the third round in Miami last month . It is too early to say that the king of clay is back to his best , and he will face sterner tests later in the week , but he could not have asked for a better opening display .
