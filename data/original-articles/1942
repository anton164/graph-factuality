She explained : ` I 've never had a waist before , I did n't have that curviness , but now I have and I look better . ` I 'm a size 10 and I love being able to go into the shops and buy a top because I like it and not because I want to hide my bottom . ' Kelly also explained that Zumba had helped her develop a new-found confidence , and that at the age of 55 , she had more confidence than she had ever felt . She added : ` I was never unfit , but I was never truly fit . I 'd done marathons but more out of determination . ` But Zumba is so much fun ... I feel more confident now in my fifties than I have ever felt . Confidence comes from within . ' And Lorraine also found a friend for life in instructor Maxine . Maxine started instructing in 2011 , and prior to this , had been a banker for 20 years .

' The 55-year-old spoke to Woman magazine about how attending Zumba classes up to four times a week had helped her drop two dress sizes .
