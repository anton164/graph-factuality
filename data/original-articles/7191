A valet parking attendant managed to plough a 200mph supercar through the front of a shop after mistaking the brake for the throttle in a Ferrari 599 GTO worth £ 300,000 . The Dutch owner of the 2012 supercar was waiting in the Hotel Exedra after attending a meeting of the Ferrari Owner 's Club with his wife in Anzio , south of Rome . The car 's owner entrusted the car , which is one of the most powerful ever produced by Ferrari , to a parking attendant who attempted to return it to the hotel in a timely manner . Scroll down for video . Parking attendant Roberto Cinti was driving the Ferrari , pictured , when he mistook the throttle for the brake . The £ 300,000 supercar can hit 60mph in just 3.3 seconds and ploughed through the shop front . However , instead of pressing the brake when approaching a shop front , the driver mashed the throttle , unleashing 671bhp from the magnificent 6.0-litre V12 engine , which ordinarily could propel the car to 60 miles per hour in less than 3.5 seconds . The Corriere della Sera said that the driver , Roberto Cinti , 38 , told police following the accident : ` I got confused . Instead of the brake , I pressed down on the accelerator . ' He blamed the car 's semi-automatic transmission for bamboozling him . The identity of the car 's owner is not known , although insurance investigators are believed to be looking into the cause of the crash . Only three Ferraris have been designated GTO and only 599 of the latest model were produced . Such is the exclusivity of the 599 GTO , that owners could not simply arrive at their local Ferrari dealership seeking to purchase the model . Instead , they had to be invited by the Italian company to hand over their cash . Only 599 of the Ferrari 599 GTO model were built , which is the manufacturer 's fastest ever road car .
