Two jaguar cubs were proudly unveiled to the public for the first time at a Russian zoo yesterday . The month-old cubs , born March 11 , were captured on video sitting before press and public at Leningrad Zoo in Saint Petersburg while photographs were taken of the pair . From the same litter , the two cubs -- one black , the other spotty -- are the fifth brood of mother and father Agnes and Rock . The cubs were month-old when they were unveiled to press and public on Wednesday . According to the zoo , the two young cats have both reached an ideal weight of 3 kg and their teeth have already started to grow . The jaguars are featured in the video away from their parents , and their father will not be involved in the upbringing of the cubs .
