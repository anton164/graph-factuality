Larry Upright hated Hillary so much she made it into his obituary . A North Carolina man 's obituary asked two things of friends and family : instead of sending flowers for the funeral , give the money to charity . And do n't vote for Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2016 . The family of 81-year-old Larry Upright added the political message to the obituary announcing the Kannapolis man 's death and burial this week . Upright 's daughter , Jill McLain , said the rock-ribbed Republican was passionate about politics . She says that recollection prompted his family to ask obituary readers to reject Clinton 's presidential bid , not necessarily to spark controversy . ` We did it solely to do something nice and honorable for our dad , ' Jill McLain told WSOC-TV . Mike Upright said his deceased father voiced his opinions regularly . ` We did this for him , ' Mike Upright said . ` We know he 's up there giggling right now . Just laughing out loud . ' The obituary also describes Upright as an active member of local Masonic and Shriners organizations and a country club . He retired after a career in the building automation industry . For their dad : ` We did it solely to do something nice and honorable for our dad , ' said his daughter Jill McLain . Meanwhile , a group of Nevada sex workers have come out in favor of the Democratic contender . The group , calling themselves Hookers For Hillary , all work at Dennis Hof 's infamous Moonlite Bunny Ranch in Carson City . The legal brothel , which was the subject of HBO 's Cathouse series , has drafted a four-point platform explaining their endorsement . ` The Bunny Ranch entertains customers from all around the globe , and the girls have great respect for any woman who can take powerful men from oppressive cultures and make them bend to her will .
