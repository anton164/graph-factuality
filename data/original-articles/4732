Weight gain : Pope Francis has been told to cut down on the pasta by doctors . The Pope has been told by doctors that he must lose weight , it has been reported . Vatican medics told Francis to cut his pasta intake to two servings a week and take a daily walk , like his predecessor Pope Benedict XVI did . They are concerned about the sedentary lifestyle of the 78-year-old Catholic leader -- who spends much of his time hard at work at his desk or in meetings -- as well as his considerable weight gain since he took office two years ago , sources told Italian news agency ANSA . The Pope 's weight is thought to be aggravating his sciatica , a nerve condition which causes back pain . Francis himself has suggested that he does not expect to live to an old age . Two weeks ago he told Mexican TV he did not think his papacy would last long . And on a plane back from South Korea last summer he said that his reign would only last ` a short time , two or three years and then ... to the house of the Father . ' Now doctors have told the Catholic leader that he must shed a few pounds as the extra weight is making his sciatica worse , especially when combined with his intense travel schedule . But the pope who reacted by joking refers to himself as ` the undisciplined one ' is taking little heed of their warning , continuing to tuck into a bowl of pasta every day . More walks : The Pope arrived on his popemobile at St Peter 's Square for his general audience yesterday . He is being encouraged to take more walks in a bid to improve health .
