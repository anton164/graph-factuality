Liverpool keeper Simon Mignolet has backed Belgian striker Divock Origi to be a success at Anfield . The 19-year-old joined Liverpool after impressing at last summer 's World Cup but was loaned back to Lille for this season . Origi has endured a difficult spell in Ligue 1 - scoring just seven league goals this campaign - and was recently voted the second most overrated player in a poll by France Football . Divock Origi -LRB- left -RRB- was voted the second most overrated player in Ligue One in a poll by France Football . Origi -LRB- second right -RRB- is congratulated by his Lille team-mates after scoring against Reims earlier this month . But Mignolet expects his international team-mate to shine at Liverpool , whom he will join next season . ` He is looking forward to next season and I think he will be ready for the team when he comes in , ' revealed Mignolet in an interview with Liverpool 's TV station . ` He is back to his old self -LRB- having struggled for goals earlier this season -RRB- . Lille were struggling at one point in the season and he is only a young player , but from what I have seen of him in training he is a very good player and will do really well for us . Mignolet has backed Belgium team-mate Origi to be a success at Liverpool when he joins next season . ` He is very quick , he 's got skill and can hold the ball up too -- what more do you want from a striker ? He has got a good attitude to work hard in training and he is willing to learn , so I can only speak in good terms about him . Mignolet also revealed how Origi ca n't wait to join up with his new Liverpool team-mates later this year . He said : ` I spoke with him a fair few times about next season about how he is going to settle not only at the club but in the city . He is looking forward to the pre-season tour and what that is all about because he has heard many things about that . ` When I spoke to him last week , he was really excited to come over and that is understandable also .
