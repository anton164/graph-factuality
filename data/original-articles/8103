Planners in Windsor have allowed two Costa cafes less than 500 yards apart -LRB- file picture -RRB- . Coffee addicts in Windsor wo n't have to go far for a fix -- after planners in the royal borough allowed two Costa shops less than 500 yards apart . And anyone really desperate can always stop off at the Costa Express in between . The latest Costa will open on the site of the former Dedworth Road HSBC branch , the last bank in the area before it closed last year amid protests . Less than 500 yards away is a Costa which replaced a cycle shop earlier this year . It means there will be two Costas just a brisk five-minute walk apart , plus the Costa Express at a petrol station between them . One resident , Samantha Taylor , wrote online : ` I think it 's mad and I wish our local councils could see that we are drowning in fast food and coffee shops in Windsor . ' However , Matt Gordon-Smith said : ` The important point here is that this is in Dedworth which formerly would n't have had such businesses coming here . ` Surely places like Costa coming in rather than another fast-food shop or betting shop - there will soon be three within a mile - is that a sign that this part of Windsor is on the up ? ' Costa 's planning application says the new shop would be a ` significant driver to local trade ' . Planners said there was no legal reason to refuse . Costa were unavailable for comment . It means there will be two Costas just a brisk five-minute walk apart , plus the Costa Express at a petrol station between them -LRB- file picture -RRB- .
