There 's not been a lot to laugh about this season at Doncaster Rovers . An uninspired campaign has seen the Yorkshire side firmly entrenched in mid-table mediocrity in League One . Saturday 's visit of Fleetwood Town , who were eyeing the beach after their play-off hopes had all but evaporated , hardly promised to be a thriller . Doncaster 's League One encounter against Fleetwood tested the patience of the most ardent fan . Doncaster 's media team faced a tough challenge compling the match highlights of 0-0 draw . And so it proved as the two sides played out a goalless draw at the Keepmoat Stadium . It left the media team with a bit of a problem when they were faced with sticking up the match highlights on the club 's YouTube channel . So they made it short and sweet , just 27 seconds in fact with 14 seconds of match action . Just enough time for the kick off , a goal kick and the final whistle . A must-see video for all football fans . The managers on the touchline during Saturday 's goalless draw at the Keepmoat Stadium .
