Brendan Rodgers is considering recalling Â£ 20million misfit defender Dejan Lovren at Blackburn in the FA Cup on Wednesday to help save Liverpool 's season . The trip to Ewood Park for a quarter-final replay has even more significance as in comes in the wake of successive morale-sapping Premier League defeats by Manchester United and Arsenal . Saturday 's 4-1 loss at the Emirates was marked by the kind of shaky defending that blighted Liverpool 's early-season play . Brendan Rodgers is ready to recall his out-of-favour defender Dejan Lovren for the FA Cup quarter-final . Lovren has been out of the Liverpool team recently , but could return against Blackburn on Wednesday . Now -- with Emre Can and Martin Skrtel both suspended -- Rodgers is set to bring in Lovren after opting for veteran Kolo Toure ahead of him at the weekend . ` Kolo gives everything every single day so I knew what I would get with him at Arsenal , '' said Rodgers . ` Dejan was out over the international break but he is looking strong . He will be in contention . ' Lovren has made only 16 league starts since he was signed last summer from Southampton but the Croatian may have to step up as Rodgers sticks with the three-man defensive system that helped turn around Liverpool 's season in December . Kolo Toure was given a torrid time by Arsenal as he reutrned in the place of suspended Martin Skrtel . Rodgers says he knows what to expect from Toure , but could turn to Lovren for the must-win game . Liverpool were thrashed 4-1 by Arsenal , and now the FA Cup represents their last chance for a good season .
