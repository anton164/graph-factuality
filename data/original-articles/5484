Daryl Janmaat has likened Newcastle 's Premier League encounter against Swansea on Saturday to playing in the World Cup semi-final last summer . Newcastle host Garry Monk 's side at St James ' Park on a wretched run of form that has seen them contemplate the threat of relegation . The Magpies have lost their last six league matches in a row - including a 3-1 home defeat by Tottenham on Sunday . Daryl Janmaat has compared Newcastle 's upcoming match vs Swansea to playing in the World Cup semi-final . Newcastle sit seven points clear of relegation - having lost their last six Premier League games . That result leaves John Carver 's men just seven points clear of the relegation zone with five games remaining . And Janmaat who came off the bench in Holland 's semi-final penalty shootout loss to Argentina in Brazil , reckons the significance of Newcastle 's match at the weekend could rival that . ` It 's a big game , ' the 25-year-old defender told the Evening Chronicle . ` I have played in the semi-finals of the World Cup , that was big but this is close for me . ` We have to win it . We are staying focused . ` Taking three points will be enough to be safe at the moment . That is our only focus .
