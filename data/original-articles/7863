Juventus striker Carlos Tevez has refuted claims suggesting he will rejoin Boca Juniors in the summer by insisting he is yet to make a decision on his future . Tevez has said throughout his career that he wanted to end his career at his boyhood club but it appears the Argentine outfit will have to wait for his signature . The 31-year-old 's future was thrown into doubt when Boca Juniors president Daniel Angelici claimed he was ` close to bringing Carlos home ' despite Tevez having another year on his current deal . Juventus striker Carlos Tevez is yet to make a final decision on his future despite constant links to Boca . Talk of a return to his boyhood side intensified when Tevez replicated his famous Boca Juniors celebration . Tevez pulled off the ` chicken dance ' after scoring a crucial goal during Boca 's 2-0 win over River Plate in 2004 . And the link was made even stronger over the weekend as Tevez celebrated his strike against Lazio in a similar fashion to when he scored a vital goal for Boca Juniors against River Plate back in 2004 . However Tevez has thrown cold water over the ` chicken dance ' interpretation by telling Sky Sport Italia : ` That game -LSB- against River -RSB- does not come into it . ` I celebrated like that because I promised my people that I would and I will do the same if I score against Monaco -LSB- on Wednesday -RSB- . ` As for my future , enough ! It 's not right to speak about me . Juve are what count . ` Both Juve and I are going through an extraordinary moment and I 'm thinking only of Juve right now . ` I do n't know if I will leave . I 've not yet decided what to do . ` But it 's not right to speak about it now and , as I said , the Bianconeri fans will be the first to know what I decide . '
