A man deliberately drove his car straight through the front doors of a police station - and then managed to escape the scene in the damaged vehicle . The 42-year-old man allegedly threw a wheel spanner at a night security patrol car before recklessly driving his dark blue Ford Falcon ute at full speed towards the Harts Range police station just before 10 pm on Sunday . Fortunately the station , which is remotely located about 240 km northeast of Alice Springs in the Northern Territory , was vacant at the time of the incident before the culprit managed to escape in the smashed-up car . A man deliberately drove his dark blue Ford Falcon ute into the doors of the Harts Range police station . Territory Duty Superintendent Brendan Muldoon said police are looking for a 42-year-old male who was agitated and driving in a reckless manner . ` The man has allegedly thrown a wheel spanner at the Night Patrol vehicle and driven the car at speed towards the police station , ' he said . ` The station , which was vacant at the time , has sustained damage to the front glass doors and rear roller doors . ' The culprit managed to escape in the smashed-up car but would n't have got far without working headlights , a front number plate or a front bumper bar . Superintendent Muldoon said the alleged offender then drove off along the Plenty Highway . ` Police do not think he would have travelled far , as damage left behind suggests he would have no working headlights , no front number plate or a front bumper bar , ' he said . ` The car may still have the rear number plate attached which is SA registered S145 AVI . ' Police are urging anyone who has seen the dark blue Ford Falcon utility , with front and possible rear end damage , to contact police on 131 444 or call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 . Fortunately the station , which is remotely located about 240 km northeast of Alice Springs in the Northern Territory , was vacant at the time of the dangerous stunt .
