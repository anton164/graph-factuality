Tottenham will resist any offers for left back Danny Rose . The 24-year-old is fundamental to Mauricio Pochettino 's plans and was signed up to a five-year contract last summer . Manchester City have considered attack-minded Rose as they draw up an extensive list of potential homegrown signings ahead of the close season . Danny Rose has attracted interest from Manchester City after a strong season with Tottenham . Rose is strong going forward but shows off the defensive side of his game against George Boyd of Burnley . Tottenham though believe some new additions of their own in the summer can make them greater contenders for Champions League football next season and do not intend to help their rivals . Pochettino is ready to sell some fringe players , but Rose is not one of them . Pochettino said : ` Danny has been the best English left back this season . I look at the stats and other players in his position . I also look at his performances , which have been great . But that 's my opinion . ' Gael Clichy , a Frenchman , is City 's regular left back in a squad short of homegrown players . Although Rose was been called up to the England squad last month he has yet to receive a full cap but has 29 at U21 level . Doncaster-born Rose had struggled to make an impression at Tottenham down the years but has benfited from Tim Sherwood and Pochettino showing faith in him following a loan spell with Sunderland in 2012-13 .
