While it might be the nation 's largest grocer , Walmart Supercenter was ranked at the bottom of the barrel in a recent survey of America 's supermarkets . The retailer has consistently been one of the lowest-rated grocers since 2005 in Consumer Reports ' annual survey , and this year it was rated number 67 , the second worst supermarket . As it is the primary shopping destination for ten per cent of the 63,000 readers surveyed by the magazine , Walmart is lacking in areas including service and quality of produce . However , it was noted for its better-than-average prices . Walmart was ranked the second worst supermarket in Consumer Reports ' annual supermarket survey . The retailer -LRB- above a worker in the produce section of a Walmart in Miama -RRB- came in at number 67 followed by chain Waldbaum 's , which was in last place . ` Every store I go in has room to improve , ' said Walmart CEO Doug McMillon in a statement that the company released to Consumer Reports . ` I can take you to stores right now and we can walk out of that store with a list of things that we can go do better . ` And if we nail those , one store at a time , our short-term performance gets better . ' The respondents surveyed were asked to rate 68 supermarkets based on store cleanliness , food quality , freshness and staff courtesy . Walmart was joined by a & p -LRB- rated number 66 -RRB- and Waldbaum 's -LRB- number 68 -RRB- , which each earned 64 points - the lowest out of the supermarkets surveyed , according to CBS . The annual survey recently published revealed that the biggest gripe among surveyed subscribers is not enough open checkouts , which was cited by a quarter of respondents . Other findings included : . Source : Consumer Reports . America 's favorite supermarket , taking first place , is New York-based Wegmans . The retailer earned 90 points and kept up its consistently good ratings for the last decade by earning top marks for freshness , baked goods and overall shopping experience . Publix came in second place followed by Trader Joe 's , Fareway Stores and Market Basket . Wegmans was also among a total of three grocers , including Whole Foods and The Fresh Market , that earned outstanding produce scores . ` It 's going to sound clich√© , but our employees are our secret sauce , ' Jo Natale , Wegmans ' vice president of media relations told Consumer Report . Natale also shed light on the fact that Wegmans is family-owned and not publicly traded , which ` allows us to take a long-range view , invest in people , and grow at a controlled rate . ' While only 60 per cent of those surveyed were entirely satisfied with the quality of their store 's produce , meat and poultry offerings ; nationwide , Consumer Reports found that supermarkets need to do better when it comes to fresh offerings . Findings also showed that only half of shoppers were happy with prepared food offerings as grocers including Wegmans , Publix , Costco , Whole Foods and Fresh Market were considered standouts in this category . So as shoppers make their 83 grocery store trips per year spending about $ 5,400 on food , what makes a supermarket the best ? The survey noted that those who were the ` freshest ' stores were usually the best overall . Wegmans -LRB- file photo above -RRB- was rated America 's favorite supermarket followed by Publix , Trader Joe 's and Fareway Stores . In the past , check out speed and low prices might have satisfied customers , but the survey said they are now also demanding a wider variety of healthy , unprocessed fruits , vegetables , meat and fish . They also want more organics and local produce . ` There 's a growing rejection of overly processed and packaged foods , especially among younger consumers , ' says Willard Bishop 's Jim Hertel . ` They 're suspicious about food additives and so sure ` less is more , ' that they buy gluten-free even if they 're not allergic to gluten .
