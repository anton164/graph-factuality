Sandra Garratt was in constant agony after undergoing two operations before her death . A grandmother racked with constant pain jumped from the top of a multi-storey car park to end her suffering , her devastated husband has said . Sandra Garratt , 56 , went through two years of agony following two back operations for a slipped disc and not even morphine could dull the pain . Last month doctors told the housewife there was nothing more they could do ease her suffering and this was the ` final straw ' , according to her husband Steve . On Good Friday , the mother of two left her home in Rowley Regis , West Midlands , after telling her husband she was ` just popping out ' . But he became anxious for her welfare and he called the police . At 2.35 pm , police and ambulance crews were called to the Cornbow Shopping Centre in Halesowen , where they discovered Mrs Garratt 's body . She had fallen more than 50ft from the top of an Asda supermarket multi-storey car park . Mr Garratt , 57 , told how he gave up his job as a community transport driver last year to care for his wife . He said her suffering had intensified in the last 18 months of her life and the pain had spread to her legs , feet and fingers . He added : ` She was in pain every minute of every day . She was a happy lovely person but withdrew from her happy family life . ` Before there had been hope but when there was nothing they could do , it was the final straw . ` Everybody says the same -- she is now free from the pain . That 's the only bit of comfort . ` The doctors and GPs , within the scope of the NHS waiting lists and everything that goes on , did everything they could . ' Mrs Garratt leaves behind daughter Lucy , 37 , son Jonathan , 26 , and two grandchildren , Joshua and Jessica . The coroner has been informed of her death . Mrs Garratt told her husband she was ` popping out ' on Good Friday . Hours later her body was found at the Cornbow Shopping Centre in Halesowen , West Midlands .
