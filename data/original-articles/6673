This United States may have been made for you and me , but America 's diamond deserts and redwood forests could net a sizable amount of cash if we ever decided to sell it , according to a new study . All the land in the lower 48 states was worth a combined $ 23trillion in 2009 , combination of tax and real estate data in a paper published by the Commerce Department as revealed . Researchers estimated that land in the country , minus all the buildings , roads and trees on top of it , achieved its peak value of $ 26.2 trillion in in 2006 before sliding down three trillion dollars in three years . A map of the US by county shows areas with land values from $ 73,000 to $ 3.35 million per acre in dark blue and land less than $ 2,000 per acre in white . The entire country is worth $ 23trillion , according to new study . Prices may have rebounded since the end of the economic recession , but the study from William Larson paints the widest ever picture of how much the ground beneath our feet is actually worth . The research used land prices combined with Census data to tabulate values for all of the federal , agricultural and developed land in the country , excluding Alaska , Hawaii and bodies of water . Washington DC had the greatest land value , with a staggering $ 1,050,000 per acre . It was followed by New Jersey , where the average acre cost of $ 196,000 led a foursome of smaller Northeastern states with acre values above $ 100,000 with Rhode Island 's $ 133,730 , Connecticut 's $ 128,820 and Massachusetts $ 102,210 . Land in Washington DC had the highest price in the entire country , with land costing more than $ 1million per acre . Northeastern states including New Jersey , Connecticut and Massachusetts all have per acre values above $ 100,000 . Above , a home in Cape May , New Jersey . California was the most valuable state overall at $ 3.9 trillion while Vermont was worth only $ 44billion . Wyoming , with $ 1,560 per acre , is the cheapest place in the country to buy land , followed by New Mexico at $ 1,930 and Nevada at $ 2,120 , according to the Wall Street Journal . Land in large urban areas was the most valuable , with cities of more than 1million people worth $ 64,844 per acre . Despite only being 5.8 per cent of the country 's 1.89 billion acres , developed land had a slim majority of the country 's value . Besides Washington DC , New Jersey and Rhode Island had the highest percentages of developed land , both more than 30 per cent . Wyoming , which like many Western states is majority-owned by the federal government , had the lowest per acre price at $ 1,560 . Above , the High Plains Desert in Wyoming . The federal government , the largest landowner in the US and the fourth largest in the world , owns 24 per cent of the country and majorities of six states including California , Nevada and Oregon . However , the land is almost entirely undeveloped and is only worth $ 1.8 trillion , which is about 10 percent of the federal debt . The government owns almost none of Connecticut , just 0.1 per cent . True to its reputation for having golden waves of grain , forty-seven per cent of the land in the US is farmland , with the highest state percentage for agriculture being Nebraska 's 92.7 per cent . Mr Larson estimated that his figures were within a 10 per cent margin of error . He said he did the study because ` Despite its fundamental role in nearly all economic activity , there is no current and complete estimate of the value of the land area of the United States ' .
