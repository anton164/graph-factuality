A magnitude 3.1 earthquake caused a sharp jolt to be felt across a well-populated area just north of Los Angeles . The US Geological Survey said in a preliminary report that the quake with a depth of about five miles happened just before 9 pm last night , according to the Associated Press . It was centered about four miles north of San Fernando near Interstate 210 . The epicentre of the quake was around four miles north of San Fernando near Interstate 210 , according to the US Geological Survey . The earthquake caused a ` sharp jolt ' to be felt in the San Fernando Valley -LRB- pictured -RRB- north of Los Angeles . The jolt was felt widely in the San Fernando Valley and parts of northern Los Angeles County . There was no reported damage or injuries and police and fire departments say there were no problems reported . The quake came three days after a magnitude 3.5 earthquake hit the west Los Angeles neighborhood of Baldwin Hills . It happened around 9.17 pm and reverberated across the city . Residents on social media described it as a ` quick jolt ' . Earlier in the day at 4.35 pm a smaller 2.5 magnitude quake hit the same area . That quake was initially reported as a 2.9 magnitude tremor , but was later downgraded by the US Geological Survey . There were no reports of injuries or damages from either incident . Los Angelenos are used to such small tremors , due to the city 's positioning on several fault lines .
