Tottenham 's Danish star Christian Eriksen may not have found the net since January , but the midfielder still knows how to score when the opportunity presents itself . The Spurs midfielder was spotted smooching with stunning girlfriend Sabrina Kvist Jensen in central London as he enjoyed a night off . The lovestruck couple , who have been together almost three years , could n't keep their hands , or lips , off each other as they walked through Soho . Tottenham midfielder Christian Eriksen was pictured kissing girlfriend Sabrina Kvist in central London . Eriksen , who joined Spurs in the summer of 2013 , has been with girlfriend Kvist for almost three years . Eriksen started this season in tremendous form , with nine Premier League goals as Spurs pushed for a Champions League place . But as his side 's form has tailed away since their League Cup final defeat to Chelsea the goals and assists have dried up for the Tottenham man . Spurs now sit seventh in the Premier League table , seven points off the fourth place they need to qualify for the Champions League , and Eriksen has n't registered a goal since netting the opener in a 3-0 win over West Brom in January . Eriksen was unable to help Tottenham beat Aston Villa on Saturday as the visitors sealed a 1-0 win . Former Ajax man Eriksen challenges Villa midfielder Tom Cleverley at White Hart Lane on Saturday .
