Jack Grealish has a message for Premier League referees : you can keep telling me to pull my socks up but there 's no chance of me listening . The Aston Villa teenager is renowned for keeping his stockings just above the roll of his shinpads . And Grealish says , due to superstition , that he 'll carry on that way after making his first Premier League start on Tuesday night . Jack Grealish is renowned for wearing his socks low when he takes to the field for Aston Villa . The Ireland Under 21 international wears children 's shinpads - and says is n't about to change . ` It 's a superstition that I 've done all my life and I 'm going to keep it that way , ' Grealish told the BBC . He appears not to wear shinpads on first glance , but does in fact use a children 's size . ` A few referees have tried telling me but I 've got to keep it like that , ' Grealish added . ` I have n't had a kick on my shin yet and hopefully not any time soon . ' His first league start for the club came in the pulsating 3-3 draw against QPR on Tuesday , but the Republic of Ireland Under 21 international was glad to get it out of the way . Grealish was pleased to have finally made his first Premier League start for Villa against QPR . ` It was a bit of a tough game to get my first start , in a big relegation scrap , but I 'm pleased even if I 'm not happy about how the game ended up , ' he added . ` I try and see it as any other football match but it 's nice that the gaffer has got that faith in me and hopefully I can try to get a few more starts before the end of the season . ` He said I deserve my start which is nice to hear and it really gives me a bit of a boost .
