Jurgen Klopp would be perfect for Arsenal but the club should keep faith with Arsene Wenger , according to Gunners legend Nigel Winterburn . Klopp is on the radar of a number of top clubs after announcing that he will leave Dortmund at the end of the season . The 47-year-old has long been linked with taking over from Wenger , but the Frenchman has two years left on his contract . Jurgen Klopp has put a number of clubs on alert after deciding to leave Dortmund at the end of the season . A Borussia Dortmund fan holds up a sign thanking Klopp for his achievements in the last seven years . Arsene Wenger should be given more two more years at Arsenal , according to Nigel Winterburn . ` If Arsene Wenger decides to step down or move upstairs , then obviously he 's a manager with the credentials , the way his teams play , I think a lot of people would think it 's a perfect fit , ' Winterburn told Goal . ` I would like Arsene Wenger to see out the next two years , and see where we are then , but obviously , with Klopp leaving Dortmund , it sort of puts the conundrum in because he 's been linked with Arsenal before , particularly when Arsenal were struggling . Wenger was coming under severe pressure , so I understand where it 's coming from but I would be surprised if there was a change this summer . ` This year we 've just had , in terms of the spending power and the players coming in , and the next two , where we 'll see the vision of where Arsenal are going to go and where they 'll be after that .
