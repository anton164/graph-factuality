Snooker star Ronnie O'Sullivan has revealed what goes through his mind while he 's waiting for his opponent to finish at the table - and it 's usually whether he will make it to dinner or not . ` The Rocket ' is widely regarded as one of the most naturally talented players in history , although he has openly questioned his commitment to the sport during a career that has brought him five World Championship titles . Speaking to Forever Sports magazine , the world No 2 explained how his dedication can be personally tested by slow players , especially if he 's feeling hungry . Ronnie O'Sullivan relaxes with a cuppa while waitingfor his turn at the 2015 Dafabet Masters . The world No 2 admits that waiting makes his mind wander to whether he 's going to make his dinner or not . O'Sullivan is Forever Sports ' May cover star . ` In snooker if you 're not at the table , you 're sitting in the chair and there 's nothing you can do . You ca n't get to your ball and talk to your caddy and say : `` he 's playing a bit slow this f ***** g idiot here '' , ' he said . ` In snooker you have to sit in your chair and watch some f ***** g numpty poncing about . Do you know what I mean ? You just think to yourself : come on mate . But there 's nothing I can do ! I can stand up and go : ` look , boom boom boom ' but the ref will say : `` sit down Mr O'Sullivan , it 's not your shot . Just chill out , man . Wait until he 's finished . '' I 'm thinking : finished ? I wan na get some dinner in . ` Oh s ** t mate . They put me on an evening match and I 've got some geezer poncing about , I think : I aint gon na get no dinner . Because of him ! And I 'm starving and I 'm thinking : the restaurant shuts at half nine , ten . It 's like quarter to nine now and we aint even at the interval . Come on mate . ` And then you think to yourself , come on , well , if you really want it that bad you can have it . Pffft ! Good luck to you . But , no , I used to do that quite a lot but now I 'm just like , come on , I 'll get through this match and the next match wo n't be so bad . ' While waiting to play his next shot may cause O'Sullivan 's mind to wander , the 39-year-old does n't get as worried about making a mistake when he 's at the table hunting a 147 maximum . ` I never worry about f ***** g something up , because I know I 'm gon na get a 147 eventually , whether I miss this frame or it 's the next frame or the frame after . So I never think -LSB- makes panicky noise -RSB- . The five time world champion can cut a bored figure while waiting to play his next shot . ` If you 've got one opportunity , and that 's all you 've got , then you 're going to be under pressure ; if you thought : this is my one and only chance to win a world title . But I 've never thought like that . I 've always thought , if I lose this one , I 'm gon na win the next one . ` If I do n't make the maximum here , there 's one round the corner mate , I just know . So I never get under pressure . In fact I thrive on it . I were n't even gon na pot the black on one . I made 140 and thought , you know what : fuck you and your four grand highest break -LSB- prize -RSB- . You can have it . I aint even that bothered . ` Do you know what I 'm saying ? Although I 'm excited and there is adrenaline pumping through my body , I do n't feel under pressure . I know that they just happen , and they will happen . ' O'Sullivan is crowned UK snooker champion for the fifth time in his career in 2014 . The eccentric 39-year-old claims he does n't care if other people think he 's ` bonkers ' or not . O'Sullivan also responded to a question regarding excerpts from his autobiography Running , in which claimed people thought he was ` bonkers ' . However , O'Sullivan interrupted : ` I do n't give a f**k if they think I 'm bonkers mate , because if you listened to everyone who said you were bonkers , you would n't set foot out your f ***** g house . So I just say to myself : great , you have your opinion , you do this . But I 'm going down that road mate . ' Forever Sports goes on sale on Wednesday , April 15 .
