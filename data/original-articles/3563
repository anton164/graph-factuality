Worried : Alice Dreger attended the class at East Lansing High School after her son asked her to sit in on it so she could hear what was going on first hand . An outraged mom live tweeted her son 's sex education class after becoming outraged by its abstinence only stance . Author Alice Dreger took to Twitter to express her horror at what she heard at East Lansing High School , in Michigan , when she sat in on a lesson earlier this week . Ms Dreger , a respected professor , began furiously tweeting out the contents of the lesson - which was filled with horror stories about what happened to people who have pre-marital sex . According to the 45 tweets sent by Ms Dreger during the lesson , stories included people who lost all their friends when they became pregnant , people who fell into comas for 11 years after taking drugs and high school dropouts . ` The whole lesson here is `` sex is part of a terrible lifestyle . Drugs , unemployment , failure to finish school -- sex is part of the disaster '' , ' tweeted Ms Dreger . She added : ` I feel like raising my hand and saying `` Can I tell my sexual history , which involves a lot of pleasure before and during marriage ? '' ' Ms Dreger also complained of the incorrect information being handed to the students , who are freshmen in high school , by the teacher , who did not normally work at the school . At one point , paper babies were handed around the class to show how ` easily ' condoms fail : the teacher claimed they were ineffective one in six times . `` We are going to roll this dice eight times , ' Ms Dreger reported the teacher as saying . ` Every time your number comes up , in pretend your condom failed and you get a paper baby . ' In fact , according to the NHS , just two in 100 women will get pregnant a year when people use condoms correctly . Outrage : Ms Dreger 's tweets , above , show just how cross she got during the class earlier this week . Untrue : The school has denied it only teaches abstinence , saying it just happened to be that day 's lesson . The tweets went viral , with people across the world getting involved with the debate over sex education . But the school has denied it only teaches abstinence - saying it was just that day 's lecture which focused on the subject . ` Abstinence-based instruction teaches that abstinence is the only way to be completely safe , but the curriculum also reviews contraception choices . This parent attended on a day where abstinence was being taught , ' high school principal Coby Fletcher said in the statement released to The Lansing State Journal . The school has taken no direct action against Ms Dreger for the tweets . They have , however , banned her from the premises - apart from her son 's events - for swearing at the end of the lesson . @alicedreger : The kid has invited me to his health class on sex ed to see how bad it is , so I 'm going . But hands over my mouth means I ca n't live-tweet it . @alicedreger : Uh oh . They stuck me in the corner with my computer and there is wifi ... so I can live tweet this . We still pledge loyalty to the flag , huh ? @alicedreger : I ca n't stand this . They 're teaching `` abstinence stories '' that worked and non-abstinence '' stories that `` led to consequences . '' @alicedreger : The visitor-teacher is telling my kid abstinence education reduces premarital sex . My kid is trying to show her studies that dispute that . @alicedreger : She 's being completely condescending . `` You can look up anything on the internet '' Then refers him to site on abstinence education ! @alicedreger : I feel like raising my hand and saying `` Can I tell my sexual history , which involves a lot of pleasure before and during marriage ? '' @alicedreger : And how I 've had a lot of lovers and have never gotten pregnant by accident ? Yes , I had HPV ! And I would get the vaccine ! @alicedreger : In fact I have had the vaccine ! @alicedreger : Now we 're hearing a horror story about marijuana use . @alicedreger : The regular health teacher in trying to shut my kid up referred to `` LGBYT . '' And how the board decides what we learn . @alicedreger : The guy telling the `` abstinence '' story is now telling us about having sex as a teenager . I 'm confused . @alicedreger : Now he 's talking about getting a girl preg and them hiding it from their parents . Yup , that 's what sexual shame does , dude ! @alicedreger : Preg girl got picked on so her friends desserted her . That 's what happens if you have sex , kids ! Yup ! Pregnant and NO FRIENDS ! @alicedreger : He and the girl both had alcoholic fathers . But somehow he 's not recommending never drinking . @alicedreger : The whole lesson here is `` sex is part of a terrible lifestyle . Drugs , unemployment , failure to finish school -- sex is part of the disaster '' @alicedreger : This guy really thinks this story of `` I f ***** up for years and years '' is going to lead to other kids not f **** up . @alicedreger : Whereas the lesson I would take is `` sometimes it takes years to get your s *** together , and that 's okay '' ? @alicedreger : Oh and of course , now a story about a friend who OD ` ed and `` was a vegetable 11 years . Tore their family apart . '' FFS . Welcome to sex ed . @alicedreger : This whole story of OD 's , people in prison , out-of-marriage pregnancies is ironically a story of this guy 's resilience and normalcy . @alicedreger : `` I have a daughter whose 21 and I would go absolutely nuts if I knew she ever let a stranger into her house . '' @alicedreger : `` I finally met a great girl who was brought up in abstinence , and her life was so much better . I put her on a pedestal above everyone else . '' @alicedreger : `` I liked her so much -LSB- I so wanted to **** her -RSB- I decided to change my lifestyle and go with abstinence -LSB- until I could F *** her -RSB- . '' @alicedreger : `` Two years after we started dating I asked her to marry me and we 're 8 years married . '' And I 'll bet yer f **** , are n't ya ! @alicedreger : `` We 're not saying having sex is a bad thing . My story I can say having sex was a bad thing for me because I craved it . '' @alicedreger : `` You 'll find a good girl . If you find one that says ` no , ' that 's the one you want . '' HE ACTUALLY JUST SAID THAT . @alicedreger : `` We can look up things on the internet but until you live that lifestyle you wo n't see it the same . '' The whole talk is `` lifestyle . '' @alicedreger : Now the woman is up . `` Sometimes condoms fail . '' @alicedreger : She says `` it is absolutely better to use something than nothing '' in terms of birth control . `` But it can fail . '' @alicedreger : `` It takes only 1 sperm to fertilize an egg . It takes only 1 time having sex to get pregnant . '' Yet she 's not suggesting oral or a *** . @alicedreger : She 's now telling story of condom box in which EVERY SINGLE CONDOM HAD A HOLE . @alicedreger : She says per the FDA 1 out of every 400 boxes of condom can be totally defective . `` You might get that 400th box . '' BE AFRAID ! @alicedreger : About 18 % chance a condom will fail , she says . @alicedreger : `` On average 1 out of 6 times there is a mishap with a condom . '' `` Every day in US 1600 + teen pregnancies . '' Lesson : condoms fail ? WTF ? @alicedreger : Condoms . They fail . You get pregnant . Your friends leave you . You drop out of school . Your kids end up in the army . @alicedreger : `` We are going to roll this dice 8 times . Every time your number comes up , in pretend your condom failed and you get a paper baby . '' J **** !!! @alicedreger : Paper babies are being handed out to EVERYONE . They have ALL HAD CONDOM FAILURE AND THE WHOLE CLASS IS PREGNANT . @alicedreger : `` You have to have a baby ! '' There are apparently no scissors in the room for paper abortions . @alicedreger : `` I 'm going to collect the babies that you do n't want . We recycle them . '' @alicedreger : `` Safe sex is kind of a misnomer . '' @alicedreger : It 's over . I need a drink . @alicedreger : I ca n't get up . I 'm too stunned .
