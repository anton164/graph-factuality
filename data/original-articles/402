A farmer from eastern China has found himself the talk of the country after one of his goats gave birth to a kid with six legs . The 20-day-old ` spider goat ' - as it has been -LRB- inaccurately -RRB- nicknamed by Chinese web users - was born with four forelegs and two hind legs . Xiao Qibin , owner of the farm , said the baby goat is growing quickly and healthily with ` an extraordinary appetite ' , the People 's Daily Online reports . Rare : This six-legged kid has become a star animal in China since it was born 20 days ago . Mr Xiao started running his goat farm in Chaohu in Anhui Province about a year ago and owns more than 400 goats . ` During the labour , I saw the nanny goat was having difficulty , ' said Mr Xiao . ` I saw two legs came out at first , but surprisingly another four followed when the kid was fully born , ' he added . Mr Xiao said at first he was n't sure if the mutant goat - which weighed 5 kg at birth - would survive . However , the kid is healthy and growing quickly - and has become one of the most playful goats on the farm . ` He can eat a lot , ' added the farmer . Playful : Miss Ge , an employee at Xiao Qibin 's farm , takes care of the playful baby goat every day . The kid 's six legs were of similar length initially , but as he grew two of the forelegs became shorter than the rest and can no longer touch the ground . Mr Xiao said the six-legged kid was born to two normal ` lake goats ' and he was puzzled as to what caused the mutation . He said he will not take the kid to the vet to remove the two extra legs . ` I want him to grow up naturally and happily , ' said Mr Xiao . Healthy : Mr Xiao said the goat is growing quickly and has become one of the most playful animals on the farm .
