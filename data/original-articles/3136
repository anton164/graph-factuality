Eden Hazard is reaching the incredible standards of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo with his ` dancing feet ' , says Graeme Souness . The Chelsea star reached 100 Premier League appearances for the Blues at QPR on Sunday and has been lauded for his fine performances for Jose Mourinho 's side this season . Sky Sports pundit Souness believes Hazard , who has 35 goals and 25 assists in his century of Premier League games , will be named the PFA Player of the Year . Eden Hazard celebrates after scoring a fine individual goal in Chelsea 's 3-2 win against Hull in March . ` He 's got dancing feet has n't he ? When he runs with the ball it 's never more than nine inches away from his feet , ' Souness told Sky Sports . ` So if you 're a defender , the minute you stick out a foot , he 's skipped past you , ' added Souness . ` He 's got great feet and looks to be a strong boy too . If you look at him he 's all there , if he wants to stand up to challenges he definitely can . ' Having grown into an integral part of Chelsea 's attack , Souness compares the rapid Belgian with leading world stars such as Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo . Hazard warms up at Loftus Road ahead of the clash with QPR , his 100th Premier League game for Chelsea . Jose Mourinho believes that ` it should n't even be a debate ' that Hazard should claim PFA Player of the Year . ` The way he goes past players , he makes good players look ordinary . He 's a bit like Messi and Ronaldo in that when you see them go past people , you think `` that 's bad defending '' , but no it 's not not . These guys are just that good and Hazard is close to that category . ' ` He certainly needs more goals for me but he 's one of the few players that gets you on the edge of your seat every time you watch him play , ' added Souness . ` I still think there is much more to come from him in the future . ' Hazard controls the ball under pressure from Stoke midfielder Stephen Ireland at Stamford Bridge .
