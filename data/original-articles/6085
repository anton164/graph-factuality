Keith Curle tells the kind of stories about management that might explain why retiring players are stampeding towards the pundits ' couch . Except that is not his intention . Quite the opposite , in fact . The Carlisle manager loves a job that over the years has seen him break and rebuild a toilet , man a hose and pay salaries from his own pocket . ` It 's the life I want for myself , ' he said . ` It gets me out of bed . ' But there is no escaping the fact that Curle is in a shrinking minority , being one of only four managers in the country 's top 92 clubs who has played for England . The drain of leading English players to television rather than management was the key finding of a Sportsmail study . It seems that talking about the game is more appealing to former players than a life orchestrating it -- easier money , less time and pressure . Many ex-players simply have no financial need to work but for Curle , money has only ever been just a part of it . Keith Curle insists football management was always his priority after ending his playing career . Curle has taken charge of Carlisle after learning his trade in the lower league backwaters . ` Football was all I had and all I wanted , ' he said . ` As for ex-internationals , I guess there will be fewer going to management now because of the money they earn . You 'd think they do n't need a wage but some will have only a passion for football . ` That might mean being in front of a camera . I have done a bit for Sky and I really enjoyed it but first and foremost I am a coach and manager . That 's how it is for some managers -- it 's what you are . ` But if you are like that you have to like a challenge . ' Few are better placed to illustrate the challenge of management than Curle . He won three England caps but has spent most of the past 13 years in places where TV rights do not sell for billions . He started at Mansfield and went on to Chester , Torquay and Notts County before joining League Two Carlisle United last September after nearly five years coaching Crystal Palace and QPR under Neil Warnock . Curle -LRB- right -RRB- is one of only four former England players to currently manage in the football league . The well-travelled defender played for a total of 10 clubs during his career , including Manchester City . Curle claims to have caught the management bug after playing for Wolves under Colin Lee and John Ward . The 51-year-old 's days are long and his experiences would not seem such fond memories to everyone . ` At Chester , I drove around looking for places to train , ' Curle said . ` Elsewhere , I 've raised money to pay bills for training facilities that have n't been paid for . You are also lending people money for wages that have not been paid . ` At Mansfield , we had a toilet in the middle of the changing room so I helped knock it down and rehouse it . ' It was at Mansfield that Curle used a fireman 's hose to water the training pitch . ` You do everything you can , ' he added . ` You get your hands dirty . ` It 's hard . Most days I 'll be in my office at 8.15 am and I 'll usually leave at 5.15 pm . Not bad . Then I 'm often in the car to go and watch a game . ` Sometimes you 'll go to three in a week . Being in Carlisle that 's a lot of time in the car , getting home after midnight . ' It 's all part of the puzzle of turning thoughts into performances and performances into results . That 's what keeps managers like Curle hooked . Curle started his management career at Mansfield where he missed out on promotion to Division Two . Curle returned to former club Torquay as manager but could not save them from relegation in 2007 . Curle tooks Notts County on a run of 22 consecutive away games without defeat before being sacked . ` Winning matches is what I love , ' Curle said . ` I got a bug for coaching when I was playing at Wolves -LRB- in the late 1990s -RRB- under Colin Lee and John Ward . ` I wanted to understand why we were doing something . ` John started showing me his coaching journals that he had kept for years , logging every session . All my coaching sessions now are logged . ` The development plans I have for every player now are also logged . I am plotting their development on my own graphs , watching how they reach targets . ` There is nothing better than improving a player and seeing it on the Saturday . ' The 51-year-old spent five years working as a coach under Neil Warnock at Crystal Palace and then QPR . Curle believes there is no better feeling than developing a player to reach their targets . And nothing worse than getting the sack . It has already happened to Curle and will probably happen again . ` The overall challenge is to build a team but that takes 18 months , ' he said . ` How often do you get 18 months in a job ? Summer is best -- you talk about philosophies and there is no pressure . Then the season starts and you need results . It 's a challenge , a good challenge . ' And obviously it 's not for everyone . For others , it 's a peculiar part of the charm .
