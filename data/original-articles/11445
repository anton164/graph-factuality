They may not be much of a match in terms of size - but that proved no obstacle for the budding friendship between this tiny kitten and the Dalmatian who towers over him . Uno , just three weeks old , and Louie , a full-grown dog , were together at home in Spokane , Washington , earlier this month . The clip begins with one of the Pogue family , who recently adopted Uno , tentatively holding him before the two pets are introduced . Adorable : Louie , a full-grown Dalmatian , is shown here snuggling with Uno , a three-week old kitten . After carefully saying hello to Louie 's left forepaw , Uno climbs over and settle down between the huge canine 's front legs . Louie then shifts his position , giving Uno the chance to nuzzle and lick his neck , before settling down underneath one of his floppy ears . After Uno noses his way forward so the two creatures ' faces are side by side , Louie turns his head and nuzzle his new companion lovingly . Throughout the exchange Louie 's mother , whom the family adopted at the same time as the kitten , looks on approvingly . According to the Pogue family , their dog has a great track record with kittens . When they have adopted young animals previously , a hug with the Dalmatian has been a rite of passage as they join the family . Getting to know you : Inquisitive Uno pokes his way around his much larger friend 's body , and eventually settles under his floppy ear . Playdate : Louie 's mother is pictured above overseeing the encounter in Spokane , Washington , this month .
