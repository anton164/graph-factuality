Forget sit and lie down . This skillful pooch has mastered the art of paw-stand walking . Loren Mathieson filmed her pet Boston Terrier , Gizmo , performing the gravity-defying stunt one day at home after he tried on a set of new booties . Footage shows him taking a few steps forwards before planting down his front feet and launching his back legs vertically in the air . He then proceeds to walk forwards , performing some graceful sidesteps as he goes . Mathieson can be heard laughing while she watches Gizmo in action . When he reaches her on the floor , he eventually steps back down to four paws . Mathieson said Gizmo performed the trick because he was unsure how to walk in his new black boots .
