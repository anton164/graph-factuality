Tiger Woods says the Par-3 Contest is all about ` having fun , enjoying it and not winning ' . Woods played in the tournament for the first time since 2004 , and made it quite a family outing with girlfriend Lindsey Vonn at his side , and his children caddying for him . Yet asked what his goal for it is , Woods said : ` Have fun , enjoy it , and do n't win . No matter what . I 've been six-under through eight , and just happen to hit two balls in the water on nine .

And Woods explained how they got involved in the tournament . ` The kids were excited last year , watching the Par-3 Contest , and I was in bed watching it , ' he said . ` I said , `` hey , there is an opportunity maybe next year I might be able to do this if you want to '' . ` They said , `` okay , we 'll see '' . It comes closer and I had n't played in a while and , all of a sudden , they start bringing it up . '
