A rescue Sato named Bonnie is so afraid that she will be abandoned again that she ca n't bear to eat alone . In an adorable video posted to YouTube by user Jeannine S. with nearly one million views , puppy Bonnie can be seen lifting her dish to bring it over to her canine friend Clyde who is also scarfing down a meal . Bonnie lifts the dish into her mouth and scuttles her paws backwards to dine along with Clyde . Given a dish : Bonnie 's new owner feeds her a dish of food away from his other dog Clyde . Clyde continues to focus on his plate and is n't bothered by his new company and from the sound of their names , it sounds like they might become partners in crime-or ` pawtners ' in dog speak . Bonne was rescued from Puerto Rico and is a Sato , which means mixed breed or street dog . Due to extreme poverty , the streets of Puerto Rico are overwrought with thousands of abandoned dogs . Luckily for Bonnie she 's no longer one of them , she 'll have food on her plate , and she wo n't have to eat alone ever again . Wait for me ! : Bonnie is so afraid to eat alone that she grabs her dish and paws her way over to Clyde . That 's better ! : Bonnie and Clyde eat together and it seems as though the two dogs may become partners in crime for life .
