After the game , Parish posed for a picture at Selhurst Park with Palace manager Alan Pardew , England boss Roy Hodgson and Bill Wyman - one of the original members of The Rolling Stones and avid Palace fan . Parish posted the picture on Instagram , writing : ` Great moment for me , AP , the England manager , one of the original @RollingStones @bill_wyman . ' Writing in his FourFourTwo column broadcaster Geoff Shreeves , who was also in the Palace boardroom after the game , said : ' -LRB- Bill Wyman -RRB- has been an avid supporter for 68 years , having attended his first game aged 10 . ` He can name virtually every player in that period , despite having spent 30 of those years in The Rolling Stones . ` Bill Wyman is not only a charming man but also somebody with a genuine passion for the game and its traditions .

' Hodgson , who was a youth team player for Palace in the 1960s and is from the area , will have been casting his eye over a host of English players . Pardew used seven Englishmen including matchwinner Jason Puncheon , while England No 1 Joe Hart and utility man James Milner both played for City .
