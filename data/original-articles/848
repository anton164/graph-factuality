Saracens are sweating over the availability of Billy Vunipola for Saturday 's Champions Cup semi-final against Clermont after the No 8 was cited on Monday night for an alleged butt . The 22-year-old faces an RFU disciplinary panel on Tuesday afternoon and could face an immediate suspension following an accusation that he struck Leicester 's Mathew Tait . The full-back required attention after the 29th-minute collision at Allianz Park , where Vunipola was penalised for coming in at the side of a ruck but not for making contact with his head .

With Saracens travelling to France as underdogs this weekend , director of rugby Mark McCall will be desperate for his in-form back-row to be cleared . Meanwhile , Toulon are plotting a move for Australia fly-half Quade Cooper after missing out on Sale 's Danny Cipriani , who signed a new deal in February . According to reports in France , the Cote d'Azur club have tabled an offer for the Wallaby No 10 who is expected to travel to France this week to discuss terms with owner Mourad Boudjellal , who made his fortune in the comic book industry . Boudjellal has already failed to land All Black fly-halves Dan Carter and Colin Slade and is still searching for a long-term successor to Jonny Wilkinson . Cooper is currently sidelined with a shoulder injury . Quade Cooper -LRB- left -RRB- in action for the Reds against the Rebels in Melbourne earlier this month .
