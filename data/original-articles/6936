It was meant to be the ultimate symbol of menace : carving ' 666 ' into his forehead . But in a phenomenal case of idiocy , convicted murderer Nikko Jenkins used a mirror - so the numbers came out backwards . The symbol is described in the biblical book of Revelation as ` the sign of the beast ' , and has since been popularized by the horror movie The Omen . However , with a series of upside-down 9s , Jenkins has fashioned himself an entirely unique - and irreversible - engraving . Botched : Nikko Jenkins -LRB- pictured in 2014 -RRB- recently tried to carve ' 666 ' into his forehead but did it backwards . According to Omaha.com , Jenkins told his attorney about the incident in a phone call from his cell in Omaha , Nebraska . It comes amid the 28-year-old 's ongoing appeal that he is mentally unstable and therefore ineligible to face the death penalty . Jenkins was jailed exactly one year ago for shooting dead four people in 10 days after being released from prison . During his murder trial in Douglas County , Jenkins was assessed by a doctor who concluded that he was ` a psychopath ' and ` one of the most dangerous people ' he had ever encountered . ` Psychopath ' : The 28-year-old , who a doctor described as ` one of the most dangerous people ' he had ever encountered , may use the botched case of self-mutilation as evidence he is mentally unstable . Jenkins pleaded not guilty , then guilty , then ineligible for trial on the grounds of insanity . However , a judge dismissed the appeals and he was sentenced to life . The decision of whether he would be sentenced to death was delayed after Jenkins revealed he had carved a swastika into his skin . Following months of delays , he will face a panel in July to decide his fate . It is believed Jenkins may use his latest botched case of self-mutilation as further evidence that he is mentally unstable .
