He can beat a man and on his day he looks impressive . But he does n't score enough goals , not yet anyway . ` You have to be careful when you time a move to one of the biggest clubs .

I just purely want to be the best I can be . ` I do n't want to be perceived as a money-grabbing 20-year-old . ` I try to kill it off , but I do n't think the public can see it that way . ` I think they just see it as this 20-year-old boy being greedy . ` I just want to take the time to think about what I 've achieved in my career so far , where I need to go and what I need to do to get better as a player . ` Everyone 's dream growing up is seeing themselves in an away kit somewhere in a sunny country . But , in reality , I 'm happy to be playing for Liverpool and trying to win trophies . ' ` If , at that point in time -LSB- last season -RSB- , I was offered a contract , I most definitely would have signed straight away , probably for far less money than being said now . ` I just think the timing was a bit off .
