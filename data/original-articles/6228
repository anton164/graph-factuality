An unidentified male concert-goer has come under fire for his offensive choice of festival fashion after he was photographed at Coachella wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the words ` Eat Sleep Rape Repeat ' . The snapshot , which shows the man giving the peace sign as he flaunts his controversial shirt at the festival held in Indio , California , sparked outrage after it was shared on Twitter on Sunday by Jemayel Khawaja , the managing editor of Vice 's music and culture channel Thump . ` This guy wins the award for worst fashion/lifestyle choices @coachella . I 'm not easy to offend , but this is sh **** -LSB- sic -RSB- , ' he tweeted along with the picture . Tasteless choice : An unidentified concert goer has come under fire for wearing a T-shirt featuring the words ` Eat Sleep Rape Repeat ' -LRB- pictured -RRB- to Coachella on Sunday . First person account : The offensive photograph was shared by Jemayel Khawaja , the managing editor for Vice 's music and culture channel Thump . The distasteful choice of words on the concert goer 's shirt are thought to be a play on the Fatboy Slim song Eat Sleep Rave Repeat , which was released in 2013 . ' @JemayelK I thought at first this said `` eat sleep rave repeat '' until I read it carefully . Wtf -LSB- sic -RSB- , ' one critic commented on Jemayel 's post . Another added : ' @JemayelK @hannahgais @coachella ca n't even understand why someone would think that 's funny ... Or wearable in public -LSB- sic -RSB- . ' There were some who were willing to give the unidentified man the benefit of the doubt however , suggesting that the image may have been edited in order to make the garment appear more offensive than it actually was . Shameful shirt : Many commenters on Twitter wrote that they were shocked that someone would wear such an offensive top in public . Misspelling : Sam Houston questioned whether the shirt was real or not , hoping that the unidentified male 's shirt was meant to say ` Rage ' instead of ` Rape ' Shout out : Meanwhile , Ben Gomori chose to insult the wearer of the shirt , calling him a ` F ****** p **** ' ' @JemayelK @coachella Is that real ? I imagine it was meant to say `` RAGE '' ? -LSB- sic -RSB- , ' one critic asked , while someone else added : ' @JemayelK please say that 's photoshopped ?? -LSB- sic -RSB- ' But Jemayel confirmed that he had taken the snapshot and seen the shirt with his own two eyes after one Twitter user asked : ` Before I jump on the appropriate rage wagon , did you take this picture yourself ? ' ` Yeah I did . Rage away , ' he replied . The shirt , which does n't appear to be sold online , may have been custom-made for the event . Meanwhile , someone else confirmed that another Coachella reveler had taken to Twitter on Sunday to share their disgust after running into the man in the controversial T-shirt . Fashion faux pas : Another Twitter user revealed that she also saw the man wearing the controversial T-shirt . Shake it off : But not everyone was upset by the shirt . This person criticized Jemayel and told him to focus on ` real issues ' ` The most inappropriate shirt at #Coachella goes to the guy wearing one that says `` Eat Sleep Rape Repeat '' - what the actual f *** ? -LSB- sic -RSB- ' she wrote . Although not everyone agreed with a majority of the public 's outrage . One Twitter commented on Jemayel 's photo , writing : ` If this offends you , you 're a p **** . Grow a sack and focus on real issues , not feminist honeypot garbage . ' Amid the debate over the questionable T-shirt , the first weekend of Coachella came to a close last night after Madonna planted a kiss on Drake , who looked horrified after the impromptu make-out session . The music festival will start again on Friday with performances from ACDC , Azealia Banks , Alabama Shakes and more . If you know who this man is , email DailyMail.com at tips@dailymail.co.uk .
