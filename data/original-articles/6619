London Broncos are set to give a debut to Leeds teenager Elliot Minchella , who has joined them on loan to the end of the season . The 19-year-old loose forward has made six substitute Super League appearances but has failed to break into the Rhinos team so far this year . London coach Andrew Henderson said : ` Elliot comes highly recommended from Leeds and has come through a good system . I feel Elliot will add competition for places and some quality to our forward pack . ' Elliot Minchella has joined London Broncos on loan from Leeds until the end of the season . Minchella and his Leeds team-mate Zak Hardaker remain the subject of an investigation by the Rhinos into an assault . Both were released by police after paying compensation to their victim but Leeds are conducting their own inquiries and are expected to deliver an outcome next week . Minchella has been named in Henderson 's 19-man squad for Friday 's game with Featherstone . ` I 'm really excited to be coming down to London , ' he said . ` It 's a massive change of scenery but I 'm going to learn a lot from being down here . ` It 's really good for my development to play with some great players down here and hopefully I 'll do a good job for London .
