Inter Milan sporting director Piero Ausilio has admitted being left feeling ` sad ' after the club lost patience and decided to sell Philippe Coutinho to Liverpool . The Brazil playmaker arrived at Anfield for just £ 8.5 million in 2013 and has progressed to become one of the Premier League 's most revered players , including a nomination for the PFA Player of the Year award this term . Inter signed Coutinho as a teenager from Brazilian club Vasco de Gama , but he failed to establish himself at the San Siro despite being handed his debut by Rafa Benitez as an 18-year-old . Philippe Coutinho has starred for Liverpool since moving from Inter Milan in 2013 . The Brazil playmaker has been nominated for the PFA Player of the Season this term . Speaking to Sky Italia , Ausilio said : ` He was just 18 when he arrived at the club from Vasco . ` Then came Benitez and the expectations were very high . Rafa used him on the flanks in a 4-2-3-1 formation . ` He was not playing much and we lacked patience so we decided to sell him . ` I would like young players to grow and succeed here ; when I seen them play for other clubs , it makes me sad . ' Coutinho made his Inter Milan debut at 18 , but was underused at the San Siro before being sold for £ 8.5 m .
