A family pooch received an interesting make-over when it came back from the groomers looking less like a domesticated pet and more like a wild cat . The dog named Stains had its coat trimmed to resemble a lion when its owners sent it to the groomers . According to the dog 's owner , Stains is a sheep-herding breed and his thick coat , which is best suited for colder climates , had become uncomfortable in the recent sunshine . The dog 's owner looks down and laughs while filming his pet Stains , but initially it is hard to see why . It was at this point that its owner decided that what the dog really needed was a new look and opted to have half its coat shaved . Capturing his artistic vision on camera , Stains ' owner laughs hysterically while videoing his pet sitting alongside two other dogs at home . At first everything appears to be in order until the dog gets up and walks into another room , prompting the video maker to laugh even harder . Stains ' coat was cut to resemble a lion 's when its owners sent it to the groomers to get a trim . The filmmaker laughs throughout the video and the other dogs in the house approach Stains as if checking out his new look . Shaved from the front legs back , the dog boasts a voluminous mane around its head and neck and looks somewhat majestic . Similar to a lion , the dog 's tail remains unshaved apart from the very top of it , while the pooch 's overall colouring also helps create the illusion . Unsure as to why its owner is reacting in such a way , the dog continues to wander around the house . Similar to a lion , the dog 's tail remains unshaved apart from the very top of it .
