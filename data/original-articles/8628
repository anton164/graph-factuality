New York Mets closer Jenrry Mejia has been suspended for 80 games without pay after testing positive for the banned substance stanozolol , Major League Baseball said on Sunday . ` I know the rules are the rules and I will accept my punishment , but I can honestly say I have no idea how a banned substance ended up in my system , ' Mejia said in a statement issued by the players union . ` I have been through a lot in my young career and missed time due to injury . I have worked way too hard to come back and get to where I am , so I would never knowingly put anything in my body that I thought could hold me out further . Jenrry Mejia has been suspended for 80 games without pay after testing positive for a banned substance . ` I 'm sorry to the Mets organization , my teammates and the fans , as well as my family . ' The 25-year-old right hander , who is on the disabled list with an inflamed elbow , will not be able to play again until at least July and would be ineligible for the playoffs if the team make the post-season , the Mets said on their website . ` It 's obviously disappointing , ' Mets captain and third baseman David Wright said . ` Not only do you cost yourself 80 games and do n't get paid , but you 're hurting everyone in here . You 're letting down your teammates . ` And that probably means just as much , if not more , than hurting yourself . ' The 25-year-old right hander will not be able to play again until at least July .
