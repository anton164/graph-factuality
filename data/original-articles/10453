Everton manager Roberto Martinez was forced to defend another penalty fiasco at the club after Ross Barkley missed from the spot in their 1-0 win against Burnley at Goodison Park . The untried Barkley inexplicably took the 10th minute kick -- awarded for a foul by David Jones on Aaron Lennon -- rather than Leighton Baines , who has scored 15 penalties from 16 attempts in the Premier League . Although there was no dispute between the team-mates this time , it brought back memories of Everton 's match against West Brom in January when Kevin Mirallas grabbed the ball from Baines to take a penalty - and missed . Ross Barkley steps up to take a 10th minute penalty despite the presence of Leighton Baines on the pitch . Barkley 's effort is saved by Burnley goalkeeper Tom Heaton at Goodison Park . Martinez insisted Barkley was within his rights to request penalty-taking duties on Saturday . ` If Romelu Lukaku had been on the pitch , he would have taken it . Otherwise , I am happy to have three or four players who can take penalties and let it depend on how they feel at that moment , ' argued the Everton manager . Baines -LRB- left -RRB- has scored 15 penalties from 16 attempts in the Premier League . ` Ross showed incredible responsibility to take it . I love seeing players take control of the big moments and Leighton was happy to given him that responsibility . ' Barkley 's penalty was well-struck but was n't put in the corner and Burnley goalkeeper Tom Heaton dived to his right to save . Fortunately for the young England player , it did n't prove costly as Mirallas went on to score the only goal of the game after 29 minutes .
