Robbie Savage has taken to Twitter to show fans that his diet and fitness regime is paying dividends , as he tries to lose the flab . The Match of the Day pundit appears to have worked hard in the gym to lose his ` podgy ' label but he still has some way to go to return back to his so-called ` glory days . ' He posted the photo on Twitter saying : '12 weeks . . 12st 12 . . 12.4 % bodyfat @JoshMchale . ' Robbie Savage posed this snap on his Twitter showing the progress he had made during his fitness regime . The former Birmingham player is certainly an acquired taste and was too much for Sportsmail 's Laura Williamson - who described the star as marmite . Although best known for his football career , Savage burst onto our screens on BBC 's Strictly Come Dancing and to his credit - performed admirably . But his choice of wearing canary yellow to promote BT Sport 's very own transfer deadline day is something that will be etched within our brains forever - alongside the BBC 's hilarious decision to include ` Worthington Cup Winner ' in his bio as he sat next to the high-esteemed Clarence Seedorf and World Cup winner Thierry Henry . The Match of the Day pundit took part in the BBC 's Strictly Come Dancing with Ola Jordan .
