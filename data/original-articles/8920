A Spanish town on the Camino de Santiago pilgrimage route is warning pilgrims and other visitors to stop defecating along the famous path . Graphic signs telling visitors not to stop for a poo break during their walk to the holy city of Santiago de Compostela , in north-western Spain , have been erected in the municipality of Lastres . But no one knows who put up the signs , which show a squatting figure defecating within a red circle with a diagonal line across it . Someone in the municipality of Lastres has posted signs warning pilgrims not to defecate on the trail . The pilgrimage , known as the Way of St James , attracts thousands of pilgrims every year , but there can be very few places to go when nature calls . In Lastres , angry residents have complained about pilgrims defecating outside their homes . The signs are posted next to warnings that urge people not to litter . The pilgrimage begins at various points , with the longest route nearly 500 miles from the Spain-France border , which lead to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela , where Saint James the Great is said to be buried . Antonio Fernandez , a resident of Lastres , told Spain 's EFE news agency that the signs are found to be so amusing they have become an attraction . Some pilgrims will walk nearly 500 miles -LRB- 800 kilometres -RRB- to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela . Pilgrims and other visitors are now stopping to pose for photos with them , he added . Two other residents , Jose Ramon Fernandez and his wife , Maria Paz , said they were surprised the warning signs were posted , as the pilgrims ` are very polite ' and ` always friendly ' . Lantres is a parish in Santos , and its mayor said ` it makes no sense ' that there are no public facilities for pilgrims at regular points during their long journey on the historic route . Julio Gallego told the Spanish newspaper La Voz de Galicia that it is a ` huge failure ' that needs to be remedied .
