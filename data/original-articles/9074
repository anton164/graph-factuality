Ian Gibson , a former soldier who had his kneecap blown off in combat and is suing his employer after a colleague nicknamed him Hoppy . A former soldier who had his kneecap blown off in combat more than 30 years ago is suing his employer after he was nicknamed ` Hoppy ' by a colleague . Today , ex-Army tank driver Ian Gibson from Hillingdon in Middlesex told an employment tribunal that he was subjected to a tirade of ` horrible harassment ' while working at H and G Contracting Services Ltd at Heathrow Airport . The 60-year-old joined the company as plane refueller in December 2007 , three decades after he was medically discharged from the British Army 's Parachute Regiment . His job involved kneeling down , removing a manhole cover and connecting the fuel pipe to refuel planes . In 2010 he underwent a knee replacement and had further surgery on his other knee two years later . Mr Gibson claims that bosses failed to make his job easier after the pain in his knee became too excruciating and was overlooked for an office-based job , which was instead offered to a man he said bullied him about being disabled . He told the tribunal in Reading : ` I suffered bullying and harassment and discrimination as a result of my disability , in particular from Mike Baldwin who bullied me because of my disability and the way I walk . ` On my return to work there was no medical or risk assessment . I carried on the work without adjustments which caused further pain . ' Mr Gibson added that he was offered a temporary admin role in the workshop at the firm in November 2013 . However , when he lodged a grievance complaint about the bullying , he was told his admin job would not be made permanent . He also claimed he was not informed about a vacancy for a workshop/site service manager role when he was off work . He added : ' I feel the reason was because I lodged a grievance and was a hassle to the company . ` I think I was deliberately not informed of the position . Mike Baldwin told me he had already been offered the job before I was given an interview . ` He called me `` Hoppy '' because of my limp . The way I walk has been a real difficulty for me . He said to me `` they could get a tart in for Â£ 16,000 to do your job , disabled or not so watch yourself '' . ` In April 2014 , he called me ` Hoppy ' and said `` I do n't know why you joined the Army , jumping out of planes for what ? This f **** d up country , you must be f ***** g stupid , look at you , it has left you with f ***** up legs '' . ' Mr Gibson claimed he was subjected to the bullying and harassment while working at Heathrow Airport , pictured , for H and G Contracting Services Ltd -LRB- file picture -RRB- . Naomi Cunningham , representing H and G Contracting Services Ltd , challenged Mr Gibson asking him if the nickname was just ` harmless ' . But he added : ` To you it might be , to me it is n't I got a limp serving this country if you want to go down that route . ` My grandchildren do not like coming around as much as they used to call me grumpy granddad . ' Miss Cunningham also said the company might have had no reason to think Mr Gibson was suitable for the job of a site service manager due to a lack of experience and that the office-based job was always meant to be permanent . But the grandfather replied : ` There was scores missing from my CV . I had one night to do it , I had been with H and G for years . ` It was a temporary job but I was told to keep working hard and management will try and get it permanent for me . I was under that impression . '
