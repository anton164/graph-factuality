A nine-year-old girl was attacked by a lion that was being walked like a dog by circus entertainers who had brought their show to a quiet Siberian village . The girl is in hospital after she was savaged by the animal in Namtsy , in the Sakha Republic in Siberia - one of the coldest regions in the world . Photographs show the lion being walked around by a worker for a circus that had been visiting the village . A lion that appeared to be being walked like a dog around the Siberian village of Namtsy attacked a child . In one picture an entertainer crouches down next to the lion , surrounded by snow . In another she is shown walking the animal and appears to be attempting to drag it across a wet and icy road using a makeshift leash . The circus is believed to have left Namtsy - also known as Yakutia - abruptly after the incident . The girl was walking home from music school with her mother when she was attacked , the Siberian Times reported . Gavril Kolpashnikov , the girl 's father , said : ` I was fishing , and got back at night . I saw my child in a horrible condition . To put it mildly , stressed . She 's shocked . ` The child is still shaking , she 's not of those brave kids . ' The nine-year-old girl was reportedly savaged by the lion , and was taken to hospital for treatment . The circus is believed to have abruptly left the village - one of the coldest places in the world - after the attack . He added : ` They were walking their animal as if it was a dog . ' It has not been confirmed how badly injured the girl was following the attack .
