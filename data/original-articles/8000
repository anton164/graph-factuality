Yaya Toure wants to meet with Manchester City to thrash out his future , according to his controversial agent . Toure 's days at the Etihad Stadium may be numbered , with City prepared to listen to offers for the 31-year-old and the player himself admitting he is open to new challenges . Now the Ivory Coast international 's agent Dimitri Seluk has revealed that he wants to talk to City about the way forward . Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure has hinted that he is open to leaving Manchester City this summer . Toure is challenged by West Ham 's Mark Noble during City 's 2-0 win at the Etihad on Sunday afternoon . Inter Milan boss Roberto Mancini wants to be reunited with Toure next season after managing him at City . ` We have had different offers for Yaya but we must speak to Manchester City , ' Seluk said . ` People think he will stay because of money but we do n't care about money . If Man City do n't want him - no problem . ` I want someone to say that they want Yaya to stay at Manchester City . Yaya is a legend at the club . All the supporters like him , he 's helped them make history . ' Despite Seluk 's claims , the fact that Toure earns more than Â£ 1m a month at City could yet put a spanner in the works of a potential transfer to a club like Inter Milan in Italy . Toure has two years left on his current contract but has not managed to have the same influence on Manuel Pellegrini 's team this season . Toure celebrates with Sergio Aguero and Jesus Navas after the Argentine 's goal against West Ham . Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini must persuade Toure to continue his career at the Etihad .
