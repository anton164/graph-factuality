Bradley Dew has been jailed for mugging his deaf friend to steal his mobile phone and a £ 10 note . A thug has been jailed after he mugged his deaf friend to steal his mobile phone and a £ 10 note . Bradley Dew , 26 , had been drinking with his friend at a pub in Faversham in Kent earlier that day and had borrowed his mobile . But later in the evening Dew returned to his friend 's home , claiming he had lost the mobile on a train after returning from Herne Bay . As the friend said he was about to go out with his girlfriend , Dew pushed him back into a wall before striking him across the face . He then stole £ 10 out of his wallet . Dew , of Faversham , then fled the scene , and was found by police hiding in the toilets of a pub close to his friend 's home hours later on March 29 last year . Officers said he was likely to have been left feeling vulnerable after being mugged in his own home . Dew denied stealing from his friend , and told officers it would have been ` like robbing my brother . ' However he was found guilty of robbery and assault , following a trial held at Maidstone Crown Court . Detective Constable Kathryn Lumsden-Earle , of Kent Police , said : ` Dew took advantage of a so-called friend 's generosity , taking his phone and then never returning it . ` He then acted like a bully by pushing and hitting his vulnerable victim before stealing money from his wallet . ` He did all of this in the victim 's own home , which no doubt left him very frightened and scared for his safety . ` Time behind bars just might give him that opportunity to reflect on what he did that day , but more so the impact it had on someone he knew was vulnerable and who viewed him as a friend . ' Dew , 26 , was found guilty of robbery and assault by a jury at Maidstone Crown Court -LRB- pictured -RRB- .
