Obesity risk : Sugary dishes are being promoted by the Government 's flagship anti-obesity initiative . Dishes that contain ` shocking ' amounts of sugar are being promoted as healthy eating options by the Government 's flagship anti-obesity initiative . Change4Life , which is being run by Public Health England to help address the country 's obesity crisis , is promoting dishes on its website with up to 29g of sugar per serving -- about seven teaspoons ' worth . Its Apricot Bread Pudding has slightly more sugar than a Snickers bar , which has 27g . A Banana and Apricot Bagel , promoted as a breakfast , has more sugar than a bowl of Frosties -- a cereal so sugary Labour 's health spokesman Andy Burnham once said he would consider banning it . Two other dishes , Banana and Sultana Bread and Butter Pudding , and Banana Muffins , contain 25g per serving . Cardiologist Dr Aseem Malhotra , of campaign group Action On Sugar , said he found the advice ` disturbing ' and that Change4Life was ` legitimising unhealthy foods ' . He added : ` One has to seriously ask whether Change4Life is fit for purpose when it 's promoting foods with shocking levels of sugar . ' Dr Alison Tedstone , chief nutritionist at Public Health England , said : ` The majority of these recipes are fruit-based . ` Fruit naturally contains sugar -- but it is the sugar that is added to food that we eat too much of . Fruit is a healthier choice . ' But Dr Malhotra pointed out that recent research had found even fruit sugars could be harmful in large quantities , particularly to those at risk of type 2 diabetes . Sugary : Change4Life , which is being run by Public Health England , has dishes on its website with more sugar than a bowl of Frosties .
