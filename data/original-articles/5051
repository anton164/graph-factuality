The Australian pair were the first to die in the latest round of executions after a final KFC bucket meal . She said : ` The men shot dead were reformed men -- good men who transformed the lives of people around them .

Sandiford says Chan -- who was sentenced to death in 2005 for masterminding the so-called Bali Nine heroin smuggling plot -- helped her cope in jail after she was given her death penalty two years ago . She said : ` I really admire Andrew . He 's been an incredible help to me and he would be there for anyone who genuinely needed help inside the prison . ` The heart of the prison has gone since they left . They organised rehabilitation projects . If it was n't for them , we would n't have running water on the blocks , or the classes in painting , cookery and computers . I would like to send my deepest condolences to their families and loved ones . ` Many things have been said about whether Andrew and Myuran deserved to die for their crimes . I did n't know those men at the time they committed those crimes 10 years ago . What I can say is that the Andrew and Myuran I knew were men who did good and touched the lives of a great many people , including myself . ' Chan -- who turned to Christianity and was ordained in prison earlier this year -- told Sandiford shortly before his transfer to Execution Island that he was reconciled to his fate . He said : ` I 'm not afraid to die but I am afraid of dying . I 'm scared of the bullets and I 'm scared it wo n't be a quick death .

It is really sad . ` We did have a good -LRB- legal -RRB- argument . We still have a good argument .
