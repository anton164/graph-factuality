Rarely-seen photos of Captain Robert Scott 's expedition to the South Pole and an American Civil War flag are among the items expected to fetch tens of thousands of pounds at a unique auction in London later this month . More than 250 fascinating and eclectic objects -- with estimated values of £ 500 to £ 30,000 -- will go under the hammer in the one-off , travel-themed auction at Christie 's South Kensington . Filled with historic artefacts , pricey art and souvenirs acquired during the original owners ' travels , the Around the World auction is drawing interest from collectors and those with wanderlust . This 1838 map -LRB- estimated value £ 7,000 to £ 10,000 -RRB- was engraved by John Dower and includes a list of the era 's major discoveries . The one-off , travel-themed auction includes a 34-star US flag , with an estimated value of £ 10,000 to £ 15,000 , from the Civil War era . One of the highly-anticipated lots contains 11 restored photos of Captain Robert Scott 's doomed expedition to the South Pole . One of the highlights of the collection -- consignors -- is 11 professionally restored photos of Captain Scott 's fateful British Antarctic Expedition . Estimated at £ 20,000 to £ 30,000 , the copies were created using the surviving gelatine positives and paper negatives taken by the captain himself before he and the rest of his party died during their return journey after reaching the South Pole in January 1912 . The photos document the building of the expedition 's base hut , the frigid conditions on Ross Island and their long march to the southernmost point on Earth . Christie 's , the world 's largest auction house , said very few copies were published at the time and many remained unseen and unknown until recently . A photo of a Geisha exiting a Kyoto metro station , taken by Steve McCurry , has an estimated value £ 3,000 to £ 5,000 . A saddle made by the Edward H Bohlin Company -LRB- left -RRB- and an incense burner in the shape of Venezuelan military leader Simon Bolivar . A Indo-Portuguese marquetry chest -LRB- valued at £ 20,000 to £ 30,000 -RRB- from the late 17th to early 18th century is one of the rare items available . Another unique item that is expected to fetch a similar price is a silver-mounted and engraved leather parade saddle manufactured by the Hollywood-based Edward H Bohlin Company , which served as ` the saddle-maker to the stars ' . Hand-crafted around 1930 , the saddle bears the company 's stamp and all the hallmarks of its attention to detail . Edward Bohlin , who was born in Sweden , created saddles , outfits and accessories for some of Hollywood 's biggest stars , including John Wayne and Clint Eastwood , and US presidents . A model of a British Airways Concorde -LRB- valued at £ 6,000 to £ 9,000 -RRB- is one of more than 250 items that will go under the hammer . The travel-themed collection includes a Maori hei tiki pendant from New Zealand -LRB- estimated value : £ 8,000 to £ 12,000 -RRB- . These Italian marble busts of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra , circa 1900-1910 , have an estimated value of £ 6,000 to £ 8,000 . Another item valued at £ 20,000 to £ 30,000 is an elaborate Indo-Portuguese marquetry chest from the late 17th to early 18th century . Christie 's said : ` The chest displays the blend of East and West seen in Colonial furniture and is typical of work from the former Portuguese colony of Goa . ` The pattern of intersecting circles that covers the surface of this chest is almost identical to a Contador , or cabinet on stand , in the Victoria and Albert Museum . ' Other items that will go under the hammer on 28 April include a Maori hei tiki pendant from New Zealand -LRB- estimated value : £ 8,000 to £ 12,000 -RRB- , a rare 34-star US flag from the Civil War era -LRB- £ 10,000 to £ 15,000 -RRB- , a model of a British Airways Concorde -LRB- £ 6,000 to £ 9,000 -RRB- , an incense burner in the shape of Venezuelan military leader Simon Bolivar -LRB- £ 15,000 to £ 25,000 -RRB- , and a silver-mounted section of elephant tusk -LRB- £ 1,200 to £ 1,800 -RRB- .
