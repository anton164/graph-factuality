A former MasterChef semi-finalist has become the first woman to run the prestigious Savoy Grill kitchen in its 126-year history . Kim Woodward has been appointed head chef at the famous venue , which has hosted lunches for the likes of prime ministers , musicians and captains of industry for decades . The 34-year-old follows in the footsteps of a string of ma√Ætre chefs who have headed the kitchen since its opening in the Strand , London in 1889 . Ms Woodward , who lives in Camden , said : ` It is an absolute honour for me to be the head chef here in one of London 's most iconic restaurants . Obviously there is so much history here , and the people who come through the door come here for the classic dishes that the Grill is famous for . ' At the five-star , art deco Grill , which is now part of the Gordon Ramsay stable , Woodward will head a team of about 35 chefs , of whom some 40 per cent are women . It marks her return to the venue -- she was a sous chef between 2010 and 2012 , before becoming head chef at the York & Albany gastropub in Camden . She reached the semi-final of the 2011 series of MasterChef : The Professionals .
