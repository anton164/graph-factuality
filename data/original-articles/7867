Celtic 's Stefan Johansen slots home his penalty to put his side 2-0 up against St Mirren . Gary Teale hit back at Celtic boss Ronny Deila for his criticism of the St Mirren Park pitch on Monday night . ` I was surprised because I think our pitch is the best in the league , ' stated Teale . ` It 's maybe a bit firm but it 's an excellent surface . Tommy , our groundsman , wins `` Pitch of the Year '' year after year and that 's a great acknowledgement for him and a great accolade for him . ` So I was surprised at the comments because I 've seen a lot of the pitches in the SPFL this year and a lot of them leave a lot to be desired . But ours is great and all credit to the groundsman . ' Deila branded most surfaces in the Scottish Premiership ` terrible ' and said artificial pitches would be better . Teale feels Deila 's criticism unfair on the Paisley club 's award-winning groundsman , Tommy Docherty .
