Munster have signed New Zealand international Francis Saili on a two-year deal . Utility back Saili , who made his All Blacks debut against Argentina in 2013 , will move to the province later this year after the completion of his 2015 contractual commitments . The 24-year-old currently plays for Auckland-based Super Rugby side the Blues and was part of the New Zealand Under-20 side that won the Junior World Championship in Italy in 2011 . Saili 's signature is something of a coup for Munster and head coach Anthony Foley believes he will be a great addition to their backline . Francis Saili has signed a two-year deal to join Munster and will link up with them later this year . ` We are really pleased that Francis has committed his future to the province , ' Foley told Munster 's official website . ` He is a talented centre with an impressive skill-set and he possesses the physical attributes to excel in the northern hemisphere . ` I believe he will be a great addition to our backline and we look forward to welcoming him to Munster . ' Saili has been capped twice by New Zealand and was part of the Under 20 side that won the Junior Championship in 2011 . Saili , who joins All Black team-mates Dan Carter , Ma'a Nonu , Conrad Smith and Charles Piutau in agreeing to ply his trade in the northern hemisphere , is looking forward to a fresh challenge . He said : ` I believe this is a fantastic opportunity for me and I am fortunate to move to a club held in such high regard , with values and traditions I can relate to from my time here in the Blues . ` This experience will stand to me as a player and I believe I can continue to improve and grow within the Munster set-up . ` As difficult as it is to leave the Blues I look forward to the exciting challenge ahead .
