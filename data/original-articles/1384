The inquiry into the Iraq war , lead by Sir John Chilcot , began in 2009 , stopped taking evidence in 2011 , but will not report until 2016 , a source said . The findings of a long-awaited inquiry into the Iraq war are unlikely to be unveiled this year . Further delays to Sir John Chilcot 's inquiry into the war were reported by BBC 's Newsnight and will fuel claims those criticised over the war are trying to bury bad news . It was initially thought it would be delayed until after the general election amid claims it could be damning for Labour . But it has now been suggested the findings of the inquiry , which began in 2009 , will not be published until 2016 . Newsnight 's Diplomatic Editor , Mark Urban said he had been told the inquiry will be delayed until at least 2016 . Tony Blair is expected to be come under intense scrutiny for sanctioning the ill-fated invasion . The former PM has denied that he was trying to obstruct the inquiry . Earlier this year , he apeared rattled when journalists put to him David Cameron 's claim , that Labour had got the publication delayed . He pointed to a statement released by his office which said : ` It is not true to say that Tony Blair has caused the delay in the report 's publication ' . Mr Blair is one of dozens who is believed to be criticised . Every one fingered has the right to respond to the dossier of evidence against them , often running to hundreds of pages . The inquiry - which stopped taking evidence in 2011 - was also set back by the death of one of its members and staff losses . The publication of the report was expected to be delayed until after the election as it is thought to be highly critical of senior political figures , including Tony Blair , but will likely not report until even later .
