Is this confirmation that Angel Di Maria is happy as a Manchester United player ? The 27-year-old has endured a mixed start to his United career on-and-off the pitch since joining the club last summer - which has included an attempted burglary at his family home in Cheshire back in February . The midfielder has been linked with a move away from Old Trafford as a result , but speculation about his future could be squashed following his latest tattoo . Angel Di Maria -LRB- left -RRB- has a new No 7 tattoo which stands out among others on his left arm . Di Maria wears the No 7 shirt at Manchester United following his £ 60million from Real Madrid last summer . A new picture has been revealed on Twitter of Di Maria 's latest piece of body art - the number seven which stands out strongly among others on his left arm . United 's club record £ 60million signing of course adorns the No 7 shirt at the Red Devils - so could his latest tattoo suggest he 's committed to Louis van Gaal 's side for the long haul ? However , before United fans get too carried away it must be noted that the former Real Madrid star does also wear the No 7 jersey for Argentina too . As well as adorning the No 7 shirt at United , 27-year-old -LRB- right -RRB- also wears that number for Argentina too .
