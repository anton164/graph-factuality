Castleford 's blockbusting Australian winger Justin Carney will be sidelined for up to two months after being told he needs to undergo elbow surgery . The news could have been worse for Carney , who dislocated his elbow in the Tigers ' 25-4 win over Hull KR last Saturday but did not suffer a break as first feared . Castleford winger Justin Carney is set to be out for up to months after being told he needs elbow surgery . ` Justin needs an operation and will be out for six to eight weeks , ' said Castleford coach Daryl Powell . ` It 's tough to take but is probably the best-case scenario we could have expected and hope to get a key strike weapon back ASAP . ' Winger James Clare is expected to take Carney 's place against Widnes on Sunday after recovering from a knee injury that has kept him out of the last two matches .
