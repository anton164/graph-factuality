Anyone with internet access is bound to remember the hilarious viral video , ` Charlie Bit Me ' . In it , a small boy named Harry Davies-Carr is seen happily sitting with his baby brother Charlie on his lap - until Charlie painfully makes a snap for one of his older sibling 's digits . Now the pair , from Buckinghamshire , who are now aged 11 and nine , have given an interview to children 's TV programme Newsround , to talk about the video that changed their lives . Scroll down for video . The boys are they are not : Harry -LRB- left -RRB- is now 11 , whilst his younger brother Charlie -LRB- right -RRB- is now nine . The YouTube pioneers told CBBC reporter Ricky Boleto that the video was originally filmed for the family to send to the brothers ' godfather who lives in America . However , it quickly went viral , becoming an early online hit when it was uploaded eight years ago , going on to amass more than 816million views on YouTube . Harry told the children 's TV show that he now finds watching the video funny , saying : ` It makes me laugh . ' Charlie said he did n't find it embarrassing but said : ` I think it 's a bit odd that loads of people have watched it . Their father Howard , had only ever uploaded the video because it was too big to send over email . Harry -LRB- left -RRB- and Charlie -LRB- right -RRB- starred in the Youtube clip which has amassed millions and millions of views . The show also reveals that the boys ' video has had more views than Taylor Swift , One Direction and even Adele . Their parents have since made thousands of pounds from advertising and sponsorship deals off the back of the clip . Howard said at the time : ` The clip only went up as I wanted to share it with the boys ' godfather . I was naive about the whole YouTube thing . ` It became viral and once that happened there was nothing I could do . People have sent lovely comments and messages and I now upload a new video of the boys every six weeks . '
