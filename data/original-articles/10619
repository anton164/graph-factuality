A man was horrified after finding a five inch piece of TIMBER in his frozen curry . John Foran 's wife Nita was preparing a chicken tikka biryani stir-fry on Tuesday April 7 when he found the splinter-covered shard . The £ 2 ready meal was bought from an Iceland Foods store in Spytty Retail Park near the couple 's home in Newport , South Wales , within the last two weeks . John Foran was horrified to find a five inch piece of timber in his Iceland chicken tikka biryani curry . John , 59 , said : ` When it fell out of the bag I could n't believe it . ` As Nita was putting it in the stir fry dish , she thought it was just a big bit of veg . ` It was a piece of wood with splinters coming off it . ` I just do n't understand how it got inside . ' Iceland said they are carrying out a thorough investigation into how the timber shard came to be in the curry . Shocked John immediately contacted Iceland who are currently investigating the matter . He said : `` It may only have been £ 2 but that 's beside the point . ` Things like this should not be in your food . ` I contacted Iceland and all they said was take it back to the shop and that they 'll be in touch . ` But I want people to know what could be hiding in their meal . '' An Iceland spokeswoman said : ' Please be assured that we take all complaints extremely seriously . We can confirm that Mr Foran has now been in touch with our customer care department regarding the foreign body found in his ready meal . ` Mr Foran is returning the item to the store and the foreign body will be collected by our supplier in order for them to carry out a thorough investigation . As soon as we have the results of this investigation we will get back in touch with Mr Foran . '
