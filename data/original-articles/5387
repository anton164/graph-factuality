A school has allowed a pupil who suffers badly with nerves to take her pet Labrador into a GCSE exam to help keep her calm . Rebecca Rice , 16 , had tried everything to calm her nerves but knew the only thing that made her feel comfortable was her 11-year-old dog Holly . After confiding in her teacher Lorette Esteve it was decided she could take Holly into the five-minute recorded French oral test . Rebecca Rice , 16 , -LRB- right -RRB- told her French teacher Lorette Esteve -LRB- left -RRB- that she had struggled with her nerves ahead of her French GCSE oral exam . Ms Esteve advised her to bring her pet dog Holly -LRB- middle -RRB- to help . Ms Esteve , who is joint head of foreign modern languages at the school , said : ` Over the years , both pupils and teachers have worked hard to reduce the stress involved in the whole experience and tactics include bringing in drinks , lucky key rings and having a friend in the room . ` When Rebecca came to do her speaking exam , though , nothing seemed to work . ` She 'd spent hours at home learning what to say , but when faced with the idea of having to sit through the exam she knew that she could n't do it and I talked through with Rebecca what made her feel comfortable . ` So Rebecca 's mum delivered 11-year-old Labrador Holly to school , and Rebecca spent her five minutes with Holly who sat reassuringly at her side - and it worked . ' The teenager said : ` Having Holly with me really settled my nerves . ' Ms Esteve said staff at Bodmin College in Cornwall have worked with pupils to help combat stress during the busy exam period , including bringing along drinks , a lucky key ring or a friend to sit in the room .
