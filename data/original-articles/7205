Why ca n't we have an investigation into where the money actually goes ? ' she claimed . When told by the interviewer that there was no basis to any of these claims Ms Hanson replied : ` Why do Australians have to pay tax for halal certification ? It is a money making racket . Why do Australians have to pay extra when they buy this product ? ' Crowd numbers grew during the afternoon , and some protesters had to be treated by paramedics .

She denied that there was any violence or vitriol at the rally . ` There was no violence at the Brisbane rally whatsoever . Islam is not a race so therefore we 're not talking about racism here whatsoever . Criticism is not racism . We have a right to have a say and have an opinion , ' she said . ` We do n't like Islam and we 're in fear about what Islam can do to our country , our culture and our way of life . Australians have a right to say this is not going to work . We want a peaceful cohesive society . ' The violent scenes came after a Twitter account claiming to be linked with anti-Islam groups has mocked protests being held around Australia . Hundreds of people attended the ` Reclaim Australia ' rally which was held in Martin Place , Sydney . Protesters in the crowd carried flags and chanted `` Aussie , Aussie , Aussie - Oi , Oi , Oi '' and many carried banners denouncing Islam . It was originally thought Reclaim Australia had handed over the reigns to one of their supporters to control their feed throughout the protests . ` Whats wrong with muslims anyway ? I dun get it , ' one tweet from the account read . ` In the car reading stuff - wots xenophobia ? help me out , ' another said . However , ` Jeremy ' began to tweet a number of joke comments shortly after the Sydney protest got underway . ` Man f**k this noise I 'm gon na get stoned in the park peace out . ' Once the tweets began to get attention , a ` statement ' was released that explained its account was misused and it then said other events around the country would be cancelled . Two people were taken away by officers after they rushed the stage and attempted to disrupt the rally . Protesters cheered as speakers said Australians had to be aware and alert to the threat of Islam and sharia law . However , organisers behind the Sydney protest were quick to disassociate themselves with the account . ` It 's not us , ' a spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia . ` Ours is @reclaim_aus . ' Twitter users quickly began to poke fun at the group after doubts over the page emerged . ` Maybe before you you practice on something small like reclaiming your Twitter account . Work up to the big stuff slowly , ' one said .
