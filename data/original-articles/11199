Ronnie O'Sullivan urged Britain 's shoemakers to spare him Crucible agony after getting through three pairs in a chaotic start to his Betfred World Snooker Championship campaign . The five-time former champion was a 10-3 winner against Craig Steadman , a 32-year-old from Manchester who endured a painful Crucible debut . O'Sullivan was hurting , too , after earning his last-16 place -- due to the discomfort his shoes were causing him . Ronnie O'Sullivan moved into the second round of the World Snooker Championship on Wednesday . The five-time world champion beat Craig Steadman 10-3 in their first round contest at The Crucible . He might have faced a fine of around Â£ 250 for briefly playing on without shoes , but because O'Sullivan was ready to accept any other pair of size eights offered his way , tournament officials decided there was no case of a dress-code breach to answer . The title favourite dug out an old pair of dress shoes for yesterday 's play , as he converted a 7-2 overnight lead , before putting out a call for help . ` If any top shoemakers feel like they want to come and sort me out with a new pair , send your boys down . I 'm not going to say no , ' said O'Sullivan . ` I 'd appreciate a new pair of shoes and I need some help . ' O'Sullivan will face Matthew Stevens in the second round after he beat fellow Welshman Mark Williams 10-2 . O'Sullivan led 7-2 overnight and returned on Wednesday morning to win the final three frames he needed . O'Sullivan won by a comprehensive margin but did n't hit top form during his first round match . The 39-year-old had trouble with his shoes during the session on Tuesday afternoon . O'Sullivan was seen playing in socks on Tuesday and could face a small fine for breach of dress code .
