Louis van Gaal has a reputation as a no-nonsense disciplinarian but the Manchester United manager punctured that image by revealing just how pleased he was with Ander Herrera 's first goal against Aston Villa . The Dutchman explained he had been imploring the Spanish midfielder to control the ball before shooting in order to demonstrate a greater level of composure . And Van Gaal 's emotions got the better of him when the players came in at half-time with a 1-0 advantage thanks to Herrera 's 43rd minute strike . Ander Herrera -LRB- left -RRB- puts Manchester United ahead against Aston Villa with a goal in the 43rd minute . Herrea 's -LRB- right -RRB- goal displayed the first touch that Louis van Gaal was eager to see from him . Van Gaal admitted that he was so pleased with Herrera 's opening goal , he kissed him at the interval . ` He has a very good kicking technique and he should be more composed , ' Van Gaal said to MUTV . ` I said to him ` you have to control the ball before you shoot ' . ` I said that to him again in yesterday 's training session , and then I kissed him at half-time because he had controlled the ball for the first time in his life and then he shot . ` But then I came to him after the second-half and he said ` without control I can do it also ! ' United strengthened their place among the top-four of the Premier League by emerging 3-1 winners against Tim Sherwood 's side at Old Trafford on Saturday , with Herrera at the double . Herrera -LRB- centre -RRB- netted twice as United ended up beating Villa 3-1 at Old Trafford . They moved above local rivals Manchester City and into third on 62 points , but will drop back to fourth if City win at Crystal Palace on Monday . The two sides then meet at Old Trafford next Sunday , with United looking to extend their five-match winning run .
