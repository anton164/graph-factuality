Graeme McDowell insisted he would never consider not playing the Masters despite another frustrating experience at Augusta National . McDowell carded a final round of 73 on Sunday to finish six over par and is now a combined 24 over for his eight appearances in the year 's first major championship . ` I ca n't imagine not coming here , ' the former US Open champion said . ` It would be sacrilege not to play here no matter how much it frustrates you as you have to enjoy it for what it is . Graeme McDowell tees off on the third hole during the third round at Augusta on Saturday . ` It is a celebration of golf on my favourite golf course in the world . It is . I love it . But it 's unrequited . ` Once I feel like I have got one up on this course it takes two back . I walk away still disappointed a little that I ca n't score as well as I feel I should round this course . I threw away shots like confetti all week . ` I think it 's a puzzle you can solve . I realised my style of putting is not suited to Augusta . I 'm going to have to work on a type of speed putting that 's going to be suitable . McDowell carded a final round of 73 on Sunday to finish six over par for the tournament . ` You have to be a ` front-edge ' putter like Bubba -LRB- Watson -RRB- , I 've never seen anyone roll in putts from six feet slower than Bubba . You have to drop them in and I have to adapt to do that round here . ' McDowell 's score could have been even worse after he was initially given a one-shot penalty for moving his marker as he attempted to swat a bee away from his ball on the third green . However , European Tour chief referee John Paramor rescinded the penalty a few holes later and McDowell added : ` I said could he follow me the rest of the day because he was the first guy who has saved me a shot in a while . ' It would be sacrilege not to play here no matter how much it frustrates you , ' McDowell said on Sunday .
