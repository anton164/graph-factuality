Blackburn Rovers boss Gary Bowyer has challenged star striker Jordan Rhodes to become an FA Cup hero as the Championship underdogs face Liverpool in the first full house at Ewood Park since 2011 . Rovers rejected a Â£ 12million bid from Hull City for Scotland international Rhodes at the start of the season -- a decision that will be vindicated should the 17-goal striker score the winner in Wednesday night 's sixth-round replay and take his side to Wembley . ` Someone has got to be the hero for Blackburn Rovers , ' said Bowyer . ` We will need heroes in terms of defending and work-rate , but we also need a match-winner and there is probably no-one better than Jordan Rhodes . Hopefully he can step up and have his name in lights . ' Blackburn boss Gary Bowyer has said Jordan Rhodes -LRB- centre -RRB- can become an Ewood Park hero . Rhodes goes into the FA Cup replay on the back of scoring in Blackburn 's 3-0 win over Leeds . Rovers were a laughing stock when they were last in the FA Cup quarter-finals in 2013 and only 8,000 turned up at Ewood Park to see them lose to Millwall , but Bowyer said : ` There will be an extra 20,000 people in the stadium compared to that game against Millwall . ` I think it 's recognition from the supporters who have realised the amount of hard work that 's gone into what we 're trying to do , myself and the staff . ' Blackburn 's run is even more impressive because of a restricted squad of 24 players due to breaching Financial Fair Play rules . They also have injuries to Josh King , Chris Taylor , Rudy Gestede and Grant Hanley . Rovers boss Bowyer believes his side will be buoyed by the ` extra 20,000 people ' at Ewood Park .
