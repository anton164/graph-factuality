Fergal O'Brien is daring to dream what might be at Aintree on Saturday as he insists last year 's fourth Alvarado is going into the race in better shape this time around . The 10-year-old gelding has run only once this season , finishing fifth at Doncaster in February . But Limerick-born O'Brien , 42 , believes that is preferable a preferable situation to 12 months ago when Alvarado went into the race not having run since pulling up at Cheltenham on New Year 's Day . Fergal O'Brien says that Alvarado is in better shape going into this weekend 's Grand National at Aintree . That is showing in his contender 's demeanour of Paul Moloney 's at home , O'Brien said . The trainer added : ` I think we are in a better position . He is very straightforward in that if he is eating well and you can get him in the field he is pretty well in himself . ` I actually think we are a bit further on than we were last year . ' O'Brien spent 18 years working for trainer Nigel Twiston-Davies , 16 of them as Head Lad . During that time , he helped prepare two National winners in Earth Summit and Bindaree but , with duties back at base , last year was the first time he had ever been at Aintree on National day . Alvarado , pictured here at Cheltenham in 2013 , has run only once this season back in February at Doncaster . O'Brien added : ` I said all along if Alvarado jumped the first couple of fences and enjoyed it he would run well . He has an awful lot of ability , although you do n't always get it from him . He is not ungenuine but because he is quirky .
