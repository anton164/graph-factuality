Jonathan Trott 's first innings on his return to Test cricket for the first time in 17 months was brief and unsuccessful , as he was caught at first slip just three balls in . Trott last played a Test for his country in November 2013 , when he withdrew from England 's disastrous Ashes tour with a stress-related illness . But his much-anticipated return , this time as captain Alastair Cook 's opening partner , was over almost before it had begun when he nicked Jerome Taylor to Darren Bravo . Jonathan Trott trudges off the field after being dismissed for a duck in his first game back in the Test team . Jerome Taylor celebrates dismissing Trott in the first over as England slumped to 1-1 after just five balls . Trott , usually a middle order batsman , had been preferred to Yorkshire 's Adam Lyth , still to make his England debut , and moved up to the top of the order . But the gamble failed for the Warwickshire man , who has worked hard to prove he still has the quality to play Test cricket since his Ashes withdrawal the winter before last . The wicket left England one for one after just five balls after being put into bat by the West Indies in the first Test in Antigua . Trott was making his first Test appearance since his Ashes turmoil against Mitchell Johnson 18 months ago .
