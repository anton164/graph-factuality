Conor McGregor has claimed he would ` kill ' Floyd Mayweather ` in less than 30 seconds ' if he was ever pitted against the best boxer in the world . McGregor , who is preparing for his world title fight against UFC featherweight champion Jose Aldo in July , said Mayweather lacked the skills in areas other than boxing . ` I do n't look at a man who 's expert in one area as a specialist , ' he told Esquire . ` I look at him as a rookie in ten other areas . If you can box , what happens if I grab hold of your legs ? Conor McGregor , posing here with his new tattoo , has said he would beat Floyd Mayweather with ease . ` If you put me face-to-face with Floyd Mayweather - pound-for-pound boxing 's best - if I fought Floyd , I would kill him in less than thirty seconds . ` It would take me less than thirty seconds to wrap around him like a boa constrictor and strangle him . ' McGregor has won all five of his fights in the UFC to earn himself a shot at Aldo while Mayweather takes on long-time rival Manny Pacquiao at the MGM Grand venue on May 2 . The most famous boxer to make the move to mixed martial arts is former world champion James Toney who fought Randy Couture in 2010 . Toney lasted just over three minutes before he tapped out having been taking to the canvas in the opening seconds . Another former champion , Roy Jones Jnr , has repeatedly called for a fight against Anderson Silva , considered the greatest mixed martial artist of all times . Mayweather is currently in training for his $ 300m mega-fight against Manny Pacquiao next month . James Toney lost in the first round when he took on Randy Couture in the UFC in 2010 .
