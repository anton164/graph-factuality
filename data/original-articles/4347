Every woman surveyed in Paris claimed to have been a victim of some kind of sexual harassment on the city 's public transport . Half of them were assaulted before they were 18 years old . The poll led to calls for a campaign to stem sexist or threatening behaviour on buses and trains . The survey found that `` every female user of mass transit has been a victim '' of `` gender harassment or sexual assault '' -- even though some are `` unaware '' of this because they have been conditioned to accept low-level abuse . Every woman surveyed in Paris claimed to have been a victim of some kind of sexual harassment on the city 's public transport . The poll of 600 women from the area around Paris found that half of those interviewed said they had first suffered harassment under the age of 18 . Harassment can range from `` insults to other intimidating behaviour -LRB- insistent flirting , whistling , comments on appearance -RRB- , to sex attacks or rape , '' it said . The problem meant that six out of ten women were afraid of being attacked on public transport compared to three out of ten men . Often `` invisible '' because unreported , these physical and verbal attacks limit `` the freedom of women , because they are often obligated to alter their daily lives : changing their routes , modes of transportation , schedules , attitudes and clothing in order to avoid confrontation , '' the report handed to the French women 's rights ministry this week , claimed . The result was to `` exclude women from the public arena '' , it said . Pascale Boisard , president of the high council for gender equality , which compiled the report , told Le Parisien she had not realised that `` the problem was quite this widespread '' . The poll led to calls for a campaign to stem sexist or threatening behaviour on buses and trains .

It 's a fundamental freedom , '' she said . Ernestine Ronai , also on the council , said : `` Attackers are the impression they can act with total impunity , notably by making use of a crowd to hide and flee . `` Women do n't necessarily know how to put words on what they go through in public transport . It should be reiterated that putting your hand on someone 's backside is sexual assault punishable by a five-year prison term and a â‚¬ 75,000 fine . '' She said women needed to be better `` educated that what they 're going through is not normal '' , and that the message must reach `` aggressors and witnesses '' .
