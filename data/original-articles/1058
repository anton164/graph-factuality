Sebastien Pocognoli has risked the wrath of his manager Tony Pulis , after publicly stating his confusion at losing his place in the West Brom team . The Belgian defender was an important player under Alan Irvine but since he left the club , the left back has found his game time limited . Speaking to La Meuse , he admitted he could n't get his head around the decisions being made . ` I do not understand . I have also got no explanation as to why I do n't play . Sebastien Pocognoli -LRB- centre -RRB- says he 's baffled by Tony Pulis ' decision to drop him from the starting 11 . ` Even if my -LRB- left-back rival -RRB- is injured or suspended I do n't get a chance . That 's frustrating because I feel very happy in Birmingham and I have a good relationship with the fans . ' Pocognoli insists that he does n't want to be one of the those players to throw a strop but may be forced to consider his long-term future . He said : ` I will not cause trouble , because I am not that type , the end of the season is approaching and I am waiting for the club to tell me their plans . ` After I played 15 good games , I know that some clubs have followed me . It is too early to talk about that , but I want to stay in the Premier League . ` I have a good life here and at age 27 I think of everything . But I am also open to a new league . ' It 's been a turbulent season for West Brom but has improved since Pulis took over from Alan Irvine .
