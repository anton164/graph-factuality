Clint Chadbourne , 71 , was headed back to Portland from Massachusetts when he got stuck in his seatbelt . Chadbourne , who was with his wife and daughter when they pulled over , said he was ` getting hydrophobic ' While Clint struggled against the confining strap and his wife Bonnie watched , daughter Kelly began filming . In the video , he said in a thick Maine accent : ` You look at me . I am stuck in this cah . ` I 'm getting hydrophobic . ' It 's unclear what he was trying to say , but probably did n't mean he was getting scared of water . After he tried to tell Bonnie and Kelly that the seatbelt was ` defective ' they informed him it was his body that was likely causing the problem . Bonnie , 67 , and Clint are celebrating their 50th anniversary this year , according to the Portland Press Herald . She posted the two-minute clip on Facebook and it has been viewed almost 30 million times . Clint said : ` We did n't do it expecting publicity . It was just something that happened . ' Kelly was eventually able to free her father from his nylon shackle , the Bangor Daily News reported . Bonnie said : ` He tried to get out and he could n't . He was stuck . ` I really thought we were going to have to call the fire department . ' Clint 's wife Bonnie , 67 , posted the two-minute clip on Facebook and it has been viewed almost 30 million times .
