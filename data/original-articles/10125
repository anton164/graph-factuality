Harry Kane should not go to the Under-21 European Championship with England this summer , instead saving himself for Roy Hodgson 's first team , according to Kenny Dalglish . Kane won his first senior caps for England last week , but is still eligible for Gareth Southgate 's Young Lions . But Dalglish believes he has proven himself capable of making the step up , and should be kept fresh for the full European Championships in 2016 . Harry Kane celebrates after scoring his first England goal , just moments after coming off the bench . Kane showed against Italy that he can cope with playing against some of the world 's best defenders . Kane is ready to be a permanent member of the full squad , rather than the Under-21s , says Kenny Dalglish . ` Harry Kane does n't need to go back to playing Under-21 football , ' said Dalglish in The Mirror . ` He proved that the other night against a defence which included two players from Italy 's best team , Juventus - he did n't look bad , did he ? ' ` Playing Under-21 football this summer wo n't help him . It will just tire him out . ' The former Liverpool and Blackburn boss claimed that the Young Lions have done their job if they produce a player ready for the first team , and neither Kane , nor the other eligible players , should be bounced between the two squads . ` I do n't think the Under-21s is there to win tournaments - although it 's nice if you do , and you do n't want to encourage someone that losing is good . ` But it is more important you look at the individual , and if Roy Hodgson thinks Kane is going to be part of his squad for Euro 2016 , then that is what they should be gearing towards . ' Kane is elligible to play for the Young Lions at this summer 's tournament , but Dalglish says he should n't go . Tottenham will be hopeful that their star striker does n't tire himself out playing for both England teams .
