Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger does not know the exact reason Alexis Sanchez chose the Emirates Stadium over Anfield - but he is glad the Chile forward will be lining up for his side rather than against them for Liverpool on Saturday . Sanchez had his selection of clubs once Barcelona had decided to let him leave , and following the World Cup , the 26-year-old was convinced to continue his career under Wenger 's expert guidance , going on to make an instant impression in English football . The French coach , however , admits the possibility Liverpool could use their interest in Sanchez as leverage during negotiations over Luis Suarez 's move to the Nou Camp last summer was always on the cards . Alexis Sanchez was courted by a number of elite clubs last summer but eventually chose Arsenal . Sanchez has made an instant impact in English football and has scored 19 goals so far this season . Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger -LRB- right -RRB- is delighted that Sanchez decided to join the north London club . ` At the end of the day , only Sanchez can explain to you why he has chosen us . I do n't know why he did that , but we are happy that he made that decision , ' said Wenger of the Â£ 32million Chile forward , who has netted 19 goals so far . ` I was -LRB- aware of Liverpool 's interest -RRB- , but you never know if it is really true , but I thought it could be because of the interest in Suarez -LRB- from Barcelona -RRB- . ` In the negotiations , yes , it is a strength - and it makes sense , an exchange and some money for Liverpool . ' Wenger believes the way Sanchez has adapted so quickly to a change in environment proves he is one of the best around . ` If you look at the qualities , efficiency , work-rate , fighting spirit - -LRB- he is at the -RRB- top , ' the Arsenal boss added . ` When it -LRB- the game -RRB- becomes flat , he can revitalise the strengths and dynamics of the team and the supporters . ' Ahead of the key Barclays Premier League clash , Wenger was keen to play down any talk of a potential summer transfer move for Liverpool forward Raheem Sterling , who has so far rejected a new contract offer . Despite the Reds having lost to Manchester United before the international break to dent hopes of another top-four finish , Wenger has been impressed by the way Brendan Rodgers has developed his team following the sale of Suarez and injury to striker Daniel Sturridge . ` He has done very well . I think he found a solution at the right time , ' the Arsenal manager said . ` They did well last season too , they scored over 100 goals in the Premier League , which is absolutely fantastic . ' Wenger has moved to play down speculation linking him with Liverpool winger Raheem Sterling .
