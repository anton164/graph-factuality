Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu has told Lionel Messi that he would like the Argentine star to stay with the club until he retires . Messi , who has been with the Catalan giants since the age of 13 , was linked with a move away from the Nou Camp earlier this year after a reported falling out with the board . Bartomeu , however , has reiterated the club 's stance that Messi will always have a place at the Nou Camp . Lionel Messi has a place at Barcelona until ` he decides to retire ' , claim club president . He told RMC : ` We work with a leader like Messi , who is the best in the world , but also in history . ` He has a place here until he decides to quit football . ' Messi , who scored his 400th goal for Barca in Saturday 's 2-0 triumph over Valencia , is set to play alongside Luis Suarez and Neymar on Tuesday night as Luis Enrique 's side face their Champions League quarter-final second leg against Paris Saint-Germain .
