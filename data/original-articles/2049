Manager Micky Adams has left Tranmere by mutual consent with just two games of the season to play . Rovers suffered a fourth consecutive defeat on Saturday , leaving them bottom of Sky Bet League Two and two points adrift of safety . Adams failed to show for his post-match press conference after the 3-0 loss by Oxford while supporters demonstrated outside the ground , calling for the manager to leave . Those fans got their wish on Sunday , with the club confirming the news in a statement on their official website . Tranmere manager Micky Adams has left his role at Prenton Park following his side 's defeat by Oxford . Fans of the League Two side called for Adams to leave the club after their 3-0 loss on Saturday afternoon . It read : ` We thank Micky for his work at Tranmere Rovers having taken over the club at a difficult time and wish him all the best for the future . ` The focus of the first team and everybody at the club is now on the fight to the finish with a game at Plymouth Argyle on Saturday April 25 when three points could lift them above both Hartlepool United and Cheltenham Town . ' Adams joined the club in October , with Rovers sitting bottom of the table after 12 games . The former Leicester manager , who sat in the stands for the 2-0 defeat by Oxford in October before officially taking charge , lost just two of his first 13 games at the helm . Tranmere reached the third round of the FA Cup , where they were beaten 6-2 by Barclays Premier League side Swansea , but a five-match unbeaten run in the league around the game saw them end January in 17th . But since then , Adams has overseen just two wins in 17 games and a run of four games without even scoring . Assistant manager Alan Rogers and academy manager Shaun Garnett will take temporary charge of first-team affairs . Tranmere have not been outside the Football League since joining in 1921 .
