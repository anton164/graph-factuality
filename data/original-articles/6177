Sunderland are trailing former Wigan striker Franco di Santo . The Argentine is playing for Werder Bremen and has scored 13 goals in 22 games this season . The Bundesliga side want Â£ 8million for the 26-year-old who Sunderland sporting director Lee Congerton knows well from his time at Chelsea . Sunderland are considering a summer move for in-form Werder Bremen forward Franco Di Santo . The Argentine has been in superb form for his club this season , netting 13 goals in 22 games . Di Santo began his senior career with Chilean side Audax Italiano in 2006 , before catching the Blues ' eye two years later . However , he failed to make an impact at Stamford Bridge and following a similarly ineffectual loan spell at Blackburn Rovers , was sold to Wigan in 2010 . He spent three seasons with the Lancashire-based outfit , scoring 13 goals in 97 appearances . Di Santo was an unused substitute during the club 's FA Cup final victory over Manchester City in 2013 , before being released at the end of that season . He made the move to the Bundesliga in August 2013 and has appeared to fulfil some of his early promise . Di Santo previously played for Chelsea but struggled to make an impact at Stamford Bridge and was sold . Di Santo played for Wigan for three seasons , scoring 13 goals in 97 appearances before being released .
