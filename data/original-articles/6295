Paula Creamer has called for a Masters tournament for women at Augusta National . Creamer , who won the 2010 women 's US Open , first floated the idea on Twitter following Jordan Spieth 's stunning victory at the Masters on April 14 stating : ` I hope The Masters will consider a Women 's Masters soon . They do so much to grow the game . Fastest area of golf growth is women ! # 6Majors ? ' In the lead up to this week 's Swinging Skirts LPGA Classic in northern California , Creamer suggested a women 's event could be staged the week following the men 's showpiece in April . Paula Creamer plays her third shot on the 14th hole during the LPGA LOTTE Championship on April 17 . ` I think the patrons and everybody would love to have two weeks there , two tournaments . Why would n't you ? , ' Creamer said . ` It 's 2015 . I think Augusta and the Masters and everybody with that event , they want to grow the game so badly . ` That 's what it is , about growing the game and giving people opportunities . There 's no reason why we ca n't do that in women 's golf . We 're just as much a part of growing the game . '' Creamer continued : ` There 's no reason why you ca n't revisit things . I think somebody 's got to speak up and somebody 's got to say something . ` It 's an idea , I do n't think that people should be ashamed to talk about it . I 'd like to know truthfully why we would n't be able to have a tournament there . Definitely women 's golf deserves something like that . '' World No 27 Creamer hits a tee shot on the 13th hole at Ko Olina Golf Club on April 15 .
