The view that Manchester City 's chance at defending their Premier League title has been ruined through bad spending gathered pace after they were defeated by a club whose entire team cost less than half one of their substitutes . Crystal Palace 's XI on Monday night may only have been worth a mere £ 17m , but left back Martin Kelly still made it through a City defence deemed good enough to keep £ 40m signing Eliaquim Mangala on the bench to tee up a chance for Wilfried Zaha just 60 seconds into the game . Mangala joined from Porto in August last year and is contracted to City until June 2019 . Eliaquim Mangala -LRB- green bib -RRB- prepares to come on but he never made it off the Manchester City bench . However , striker Glenn Murray succeeded in putting another dent in City 's chances of redeeming themselves after a run of four losses away , when he scored Palace 's first goal . Murray cost Palace nothing when joined from arch rivals Brighton in 2011 . Jason Puncheon , signed for a comparative pittance of £ 1.9 m , delivered City their final blow with a goal from a finely executed free-kick . Glenn Murray -LRB- left -RRB- cost Palace nothing four years ago yet found a way past the City defence . Another expensive City player , £ 24m-man Yaya Toure , got his team back in the game with 12 minutes left , but they could n't penetrate Palace 's defence to find an equaliser and a 2-1 defeat leaves them nine points adrift of the top . Toure joined from Barcelona in July 2010 and is contracted to City until 2017 . After spending a total of £ 500m pounds on transfer fees , City might have expected to be higher than a precarious fourth in the league , but judging by their latest results , it 's teams like Crystal Palace that seem to be getting their value for money . Mangala has endured a miserable first season at the Etihad Stadium since his £ 40million move .
