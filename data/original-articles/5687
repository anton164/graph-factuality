Those under 34 tend to be more religious than other age groups , the survey by market researcher Win/Gallup International Association found . Those without a formal education were also more likely to practise a faith . ` Religion continues to dominate our everyday lives and we see that the total number of people who consider themselves to be religious is actually relatively high , ' said Jean-Marc Leger , president of Win/Gallup International Association . ` Furthermore , with the trend of an increasingly religious youth globally , we can assume that the number of people who consider themselves religious will only continue to increase . ' The poll questioned 63,898 people - around 1,000 in each country - at the end of last year . Thailand was the most religious country at 94 per cent .
