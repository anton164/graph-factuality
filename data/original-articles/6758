A once in a lifetime shot , they said , but it appears Charlie Adam has done it before . The Stoke midfielder has been the talk of football this Easter weekend after his incredible 66-yard goal against Chelsea . Adam 's sweetly struck left-footed strike gave goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois absolutely no chance . Scroll down to watch video of Charlie Adam scoring from the halfway line in 2009 . Charlie Adam picks the ball up inside his own half during a reserve match against Accrington Stanley . Adam knocks the ball out in front of him before spotting the goalkeeper of his line and shooting . The Stanley keeper tries desperately to stop the ball as it sails towards the goal . The goalkeeper is left sprawled on the floor as the ball hits the back of the net . And that is not the first time the Scot has had a goalkeeper frantically back-pedalling before picking the ball out of his own net . Back in 2009 , Adam scored a similar effort for Blackpool reserves against Accrington Stanley . He was in the opposition half this time though was out wide before hitting an effort that draws similarities with David Beckham 's famous goal against Wimbledon in 1996 . The stage , it has to be said , was far smaller too , though it 's easy to see why Adam backed himself at Stamford Bridge on this evidence .
