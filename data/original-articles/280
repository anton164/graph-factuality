It is easy to be envious of celebrities who upload luxurious photos on Instagram from their private planes or VIP lounges . But a life spent criss-crossing the globe is n't always as exciting and glamorous as we may think . Proving that stars are n't immune to the everyday problems the average traveller faces , professional golfer Russell Henley received a lot of sympathy when United Airlines - the official carrier of the PGA - apparently ` lost ' his clubs . He is not the only one to have had a less-than-ideal experience , with Kim Kardashian , Colleen Rooney and Maisie Williams joining the ranks of irritated travellers . Pro-golfer Russell Henley flew to Georgia last Sunday - sadly his golf clubs did not . Russell Henley tweeted his frustration to United Airlines , who misplaced his golf clubs when he was en route to the Master 's tournament this week . RUSSELL HENLEY . Starring in the Master 's golf tournament in Georgia this week is one of the highlights of a pro-golfer 's professional years . Russell Henley flew in for the prestigious competition last Sunday to prepare - however his golf clubs did not . But , ever the professional , the sportsman did n't have a meltdown on Twitter , he simply used his social media site to point out that he had a ` tourney ' to play in this week . Clearly , his cool-headed response paid off and just six hours later , United returned his clubs to him . Henley was quick to thank the airline and even apologised ` for the mix-up ' . Naomi Campbell at the airport from a flight from London . The model flew into a rage when her suitcases were not loaded onto her plane and demanded the captain find them and personally show them to her . NAOMI CAMPBELL . The jetsetting model is infamous for her temper and it seems she was not impressed when informed she was among passengers whose bags had failed to be loaded on a British Airways flight from London to Los Angeles in April 2008 . The captain made the decision to personally speak to her to apologise for the error , but the model flew into a rage at the mishap , which happened shortly after the disastrous opening of BA 's Terminal 5 at Heathrow - when problems with baggage systems meant many passengers were forced to fly without their luggage . Uxbridge Magistrates ' Court heard how the model shouted at the captain saying : ` I ca n't believe you have lost my f ****** bag . Bring me my f ****** bags now . ' When he walked off she was reported to shout after him claiming : ` You are a racist . You would n't be doing this if I was white . ' She was later forcibly removed from the plane by police with whom she had a further confrontation . She later pleaded guilty to two counts of assaulting a police officer , one count of disorderly conduct likely to cause harassment , alarm or distress and using threatening , abusive words or behaviour . The star was fined £ 2,300 , ordered to pay £ 200 in compensation to the police officers she attacked , £ 150 to the BA captain and complete 200 hours of community service . Stark reality of flying : The Game of Thrones star was banned from the British Airways business lounge for not being 18 . Maisie Williams , who plays the sword-wielding Arya Stark , hit back at British Airways for their no under-18s rule . MAISIE WILLIAMS . Despite holding her own in Westeros , it appears Game of Thrones star Maisie Williams , who plays the feisty Arya Stark , can not be trusted in the British Airways business lounge . As she was under the age of 18 , the actress and business class traveller was forced to spend her time at the airport away from the comforts of the lounge , which includes meals , drinks and even exclusive spa treatments . Although she was adamant she did not want special treatment and it was more the principle that she was old enough to travel , but not old enough to sit in the lounge , the airline did not budge on the rules . BA simply tweeted back with the reply : ` Hi Maisie . We 're sorry if you were disappointed , lounge guests must be 18 or older . We look forward to welcoming you soon . ' The reply was not enough for Maisie : ` Yes . . @British_Airways fully understand that , my question is why ? Why can we travel alone but not use the lounge ? It makes no sense . ' British Airways then explained it was because the business class lounges offer a self-service complimentary bar stocked with alcohol which is not monitored by staff round the clock .

She tweeted : ` Bags , shoes , bikinis , clothes , toiletries , underwear , pj 's , make up , toiletries taken . Disgusting & the customer service getting is terrible . ' The issue was a result of a computer glitch at Heathrow Terminal 5 , which caused conveyor belts which loaded bags onto planes to shut down . Staff were left having to load the bags manually , but were not able to keep up with the busy flight schedules , resulting in many planes departing without bags being loaded . Heathrow declined to comment on Mrs Rooney 's situation but British Airways said they had contacted Mrs Rooney to begin an investigation into the incident . Mrs Rooney faced a string of sarcastic comments from some of her followers who commented that she could probably afford to replace the items . But she angrily replied that the money was n't the issue , tweeting : ` And you can stick all the sarcastic comments about money . It 's not all about money it 's about people going through my personal stuff and taking stuff that I need for my holiday ' .
