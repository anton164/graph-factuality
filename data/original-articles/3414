If you open your suitcase after leaving the airport with damaged goods inside , this might be the reason why . An airport luggage conveyor belt has a novel way of separating bags into the correct queues - but it 's a somewhat cut and thrust job . As the suitcases whizz round on the belt , out of nowhere a mechanical arm slams into the bags and and thrusts them onto a lower track . The red and black luggage moves along the conveyor after being taken from the plane . Suddenly the mechanical arm springs into action giving the luggage some brute force . And with a sharp movement , the red and black case is passed down onto a lower conveyor belt . The mechanism appears to work on a sensor system , ensuring it strikes out at the centre of the luggage so as to not spin it , but what might shock is the force of the action . It is not known where this video was taken , although it is believed to be an international airport . However baggage pushers like this are used at airports all over the world , with Dutch company Vanderlande market leaders in the machinery . Their ` Parallel Pusher , ' similar to the one in this video , is a widely used horizontal divert pusher that sorts single bags to one destination only . When the pusher is activated , a pusher plate operates at 90 degrees to the transport direction and pushes the bag into a destination or onto a connection conveyor . This suitcase is set for a ride on a different conveyor in a matter of seconds . The arm extends out to separate the luggage in the hope it arrives with its owner . The video , after being uploaded to YouTube , has been met with mixed responses . User Stephanie O wrote : ` This is the real reason why your baggage is destroyed at the airport ' , while Sarah Cartwright added : ` Vicious airport baggage packer . ' DMTRYP says what most people would think on viewing the video , writing : ` Hope none of the souvenirs were made out of glass or ceramics . '
