Having fallen behind early on , City stormed back to win thanks to goals from Aaron Nemane , Barker -LRB- 2 -RRB- , Boadu , Celina and Ambrose .

A tough trip to Newcastle United followed but the Blues finally prevailed in extra time with Brown , Solanke and Abraham on the scoresheet in a 3-0 win at St James ' Park . That set up a tasty semi-final tie with Tottenham and all seemed lost when Spurs took a 2-0 lead from the first leg at White Hart Lane . Chelsea were to fall further behind in the second leg at Stamford Bridge but mounted an extraordinary fightback . Izzy Brown -LRB- centre -RRB- scores for Cheslea against Tottenham as they staged a thrilling comeback last month .

He went on to make just five first-team appearances for City and now plays , aged 25 , for Lekhwiya in the Qatari Stars League . Chelsea have made the competition their own in recent years and this is their fifth final in six seasons . Their wins in 2010 , 2012 and 2014 added to earlier successes in 1960 and 1961 . WHAT ARE THEY SAYING ? City coach Jason Wilcox : ` Our job is to recruit local lads . If we can get a group of Manchester-born lads into the first team then that 's the ideal scenario . To do that is going to be really difficult but that 's the challenge . We do n't want local lads playing for Tottenham , Arsenal or Chelsea . It 's up to us to make sure that , via the scouting , we have at least the opportunity of showing them our programme . I 'm convinced once they see us it 's very difficult to walk away from . ' Chelsea coach Joe Edwards : ` Winning breeds confidence so to have a group of players coming back for this game who were crowned European champions last week -LSB- when the Under-19s won the UEFA Youth League -RSB- is a massive plus for us . Once you get a taste of winning , you want that feeling again and again . ' PLAYERS TO WATCH . MANCHESTER CITY .
