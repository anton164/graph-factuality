It would n't make much of a breakfast , but this tiny egg could give a schoolgirl and her pet hens a place in the Guinness Book of Records . Shannon Hayes , 12 , believes one of them has laid the smallest chicken egg in the world . After doing some research on the internet , she thinks its length of 1.8 cm -- smaller than a 5p coin -- shaves two millimetres off the previous title-holder . Shannon said : ` I 'm confident it 's the smallest . It is very tiny and you would n't want it for breakfast .

The tiny egg , left , is only a small fraction of the normal size of the traditional breakfast favourite , right . The tiny egg , which was laid in Capel Iwan , Carmarthenshire , is smaller than a five pence piece , pictured . She keeps seven hens at her family home in Capel Iwan , Carmarthenshire , but she is not sure which laid the tiny egg . Shannon spotted it among the ordinary-sized eggs in her hen coop . Fearful of it being crushed , she immediately took it into the house to be measured . In 2011 , an American farmer claimed his hen had laid the world 's smallest chicken egg , measuring 2.1 cm long . That was beaten in 2014 by an egg one millimetre smaller laid in Somerset by a hen called Muffin . Meanwhile , Shannon is storing her potential world record-breaker it in the fridge for safe-keeping . Shannon believes that her egg , which measures just 1.8 cm in length is 3 mm smaller than the current record .
