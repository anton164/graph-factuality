Randy Lerner is expected to make a rare appearance at Aston Villa 's FA Cup semi-final against Liverpool at Wembley in what could be his last match as chairman of the club . The American owner is scheduled to fly across the Atlantic for the grandest occasion during his tenure since Villa 's 2010 League Cup final against Manchester United in the same stadium . Aston Villa owner Randy Lerner will attend their FA Cup semi-final with Liverpool at Wembley on Sunday . The American has hardly seen Villa play in person during his nine-year ownership of the club . Christian Benteke , who scored for Villa against Spurs on Saturday , will be hoping to fire them to the final . Lerner , while watching games via stream in New York , has hardly seen Villa play in person in recent years , after acquiring the club in 2006 . When he attended Arsenal 's visit to Villa Park in September it was his first home match since December 2012 . Lerner has been publicly trying to sell Villa since last May , and is hopeful of concluding a deal worth around Â£ 150million once the season is finished .
