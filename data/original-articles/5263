Ten top doctors sent a letter to Columbia University urging the school to remove TV celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz from his faculty position because he is a ` charlatan ' who promotes ` quack treatments ' ` I bring the public information that will help them on their path to be their best selves , ' Oz said in a statement released through a representative of The Dr. Oz Show , according to USA Today . Columbia 's Medical and Health Sciences Center . He continued : ` We provide multiple points of view , including mine , which is offered without conflict of interest . That does n't sit well with certain agendas which distort the facts . ' Dr Henry Miller of California 's Stanford University led the effort and he was the first person to sign the letter , the New York Daily News reported . Miller said : ` He 's a quack and a fake and a charlatan . ` I think I know the motivation at Columbia . ` They 're star-struck , and like having on their faculty the best-known doctor in the country . ` But the fact is that his advice endangers patients , and this does n't seem to faze them . ' He told CBS News that ` a person who endangers patients and is a menace to public health should not be on the faculty of a prestigious medical institution ' . The nine other doctors from across the country included Dr Joel Tepper , a cancer researcher from the University of North Carolina School of Medicine , and Dr Gilbert Ross of the American Council on Science and Health in New York City . The physicians accused Dr Oz of pushing ` miracle ' weight-loss supplements with no scientific proof that they work . The doctors wrote that Oz , for years a world-class Columbia cardiothoracic surgeon , has ` misled and endangered ' the public .

The letter read : ` He has manifested an egregious lack of integrity by promoting quack treatments and cures in the interest of personal financial gain . ` Thus , Dr Oz is guilty of either outrageous conflicts of interest or flawed judgments about what constitutes appropriate medical treatments , or both . The New York Ivy League school responded Thursday , issuing a statement to The Associated Press saying only that the school ` is committed to the principle of academic freedom and to upholding faculty members ' freedom of expression for statements they make in public discussion . ' Dr Oz first came to public attention as a frequent television guest of Oprah Winfrey . For the past five years , he 's been the host of The Dr Oz Show . Last year , he appeared before a US Senate panel that accused him of endorsing products that were medically unsound . At the time , the doctor acknowledged some of the products he advised his viewers to use ` do n't have the scientific muster to present as fact . ' A show representative did not immediately return a call Thursday from the AP seeking comment . As vice chairman of Columbia 's surgery department , Dr Oz still occasionally teaches , said Douglas Levy , spokesman for the Columbia University Medical Center . The controversy did not die down after his testimony . The company behind the `` miracle '' diet supplement in question later agreed to pay a $ 3.5 million settlement over false advertising . A study that purported to prove the product 's weight-loss benefits turned out to be based on fraudulent data and was retracted .
