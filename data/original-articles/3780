From bank overdraft fees to charges for booking tickets and even spending a penny , being a consumer can be a very expensive business . But of all the fees consumers have to fork out for the ones they hate the most are unreasonable parking charges , a survey found . They topped a table of the most-loathed fees and charges in the poll by insurer Direct Line , followed by ATM cash withdrawal fees and debit and credit card surcharges for booking items such as air travel . Most-loathed : A poll found that parking charges topped the list of fees and charges that frustrate consumers the most . A total of 48 per cent thought they should be free , while 31 per cent said they are too high . Asked about their frustration with such charges , 48 per cent said they should be free , while 31 per cent thought they are too high and 15 per cent say they are often hidden . Direct Line spokesman Gus Park said : ` These types of fees and charges can be very frustrating because they tend to cover things that we either feel entitled to or think we have already paid for as part of another product or service . ' It is hardly surprising that parking costs infuriate drivers as the fines are often extortionate compared to the price of a ticket . Parking charges and fines made councils in England a record £ 667million last year , according to figures from the RAC Foundation -- up 12 per cent on the previous year . Most ATMs are free to use , but those in places such as nightclubs and some corner shops can charge around £ 1.50 to withdraw cash . Renewing a passport was made £ 5 cheaper to £ 72.50 in 2012 , but it is still a hefty sum that stands in the way of a foreign holiday . Annoyance : Also high up on the list of most-hated charges are ATM cash withdrawal fees . Most ATMs are free to use , but those in places such as nightclubs and some corner shops can charge around £ 1.50 .
