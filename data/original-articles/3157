A Saudi Arabian citizen has captured intense footage of a sandstorm sweeping its way across a street , engulfing everything in its path . Sandstorms caused havoc in Saudi Arabia last week with a number of flights being cancelled and schools being forced to close . Car crashes were also reported in other areas as parts of the Arabian Peninsula were plunged into darkness . Strong winds are believed to have caused the disruption , which resulted in nearby Dubai 's skyline almost disappearing and people suffering from respiratory problems . The footage , captured on camera in Saudi Arabia by Mohammed Mohsen , shows the sandstorm sweeping into the area in which he stands at a staggering speed . Like the aftermath of an explosion , the orange cloud engulfs the road and nearby buildings while it continues to move forward . Mohammed Mohsen captures the orange cloud getting thicker as it disperses and engulfs the road . The orange cloud gets thicker and drastically reduces visibility across the entire Arab state . Getting thicker , the cloud suddenly becomes darker and is it disperses further sunlight becomes drastically reduced . A number of people stand alongside the video maker , staring in awe and filming the large cloud on their own camera phones . The video concludes with the filmmaker moving the camera around to show the sheer capacity of the cloud , which he is now very much encapsulated within . Mohammed Mohsen films the cloud above his head and captures the moment he becomes engulfed within it . Last week the storm filled Saudi Arabia 's air before spreading across the peninsula into the United Arab Emirates , Oman and Yemen . Despite sandstorms being a relatively common occurrence in this part of the world , they are not generally this big and rarely wreak so much havoc . Many people took to social media to upload the images they had taken of the sandstorm and share their experiences .
