Thousands of live earthworms have been falling from the sky in Norway - a rare phenomenon being reported across large swathes of the south of the country . A biology teacher discovered the worms on the surface of the snow while he was skiing in the mountains near Bergen at the weekend . Numerous reports have been coming in after he told his story , and there have been sightings of worm rainfall . Worm rainfall : Karstein Erstad took this photograph of the worms he discovered in the snow on Sunday . Teacher Karstein Erstad told Norwegian news website The Local : ` When I found them on the snow they seemed to be dead , but when I put them in my hand I found that they were alive . ' Initially he thought they had wiggled their way through the snow , but dismissed this when he realised it was up to a metre deep in some places . Following Mr Erstad 's discovery on Sunday , there have been similar reports in southern Norway and sightings of worm rainfall in Lind√•s and Suldal near Bergen , and also hundreds of miles away in Femunden . The biology teacher told The Local : ` It 's a very rare phenomenon . ` It 's difficult to say how many times it happens , but it has only been reported a very few times . ' After Mr Erstad found the worms on Sunday , there have been multiple reports or worm rainfall in Norway . He said he found reports of the same strange phenomenon taking place in Sweden in the 1920s . In 2011 , a group of pupils playing football at a school in Scotland witnessed worms falling from the sky . The students at Galashiels Academy in Selkirkshire had to abandon their game when the invertebrates began falling on them . According to the Mother Nature Network , some incidents of creatures falling from the sky have taken place after tornadoes and storms and scientists think they could have been picked up and carried for miles .
