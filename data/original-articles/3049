Zenit 's No 7 's previous deal , reportedly worth more than Â£ 5million a year , had been due to expire in summer 2017 . The club did not provide any financial details of the new contract - with the striker having netted 15 goals in 33 appearances for the Russian giants in all competitions at present . Hulk 's new contract comes at a time when many Russian football clubs are struggling with financial problems because of the low value of the ruble , which has lost almost half of its value against the dollar in the last 12 months - with Rotor Volgograd going bankrupt earlier this month . Top players in Russia are typically paid in dollars or euros , but club budgets are in rubles , putting pressure on clubs ' finances .
