Bayern Munich coach Pep Guardiola says his team 's injury situation is ` critical , very critical ' ahead of the Bundesliga match against Eintracht Frankfurt and the Champions League quarter final game against FC Porto . Guardiola spoke after defender Mehdi Benatia was ruled out for up to four weeks with a hamstring injury . Wingers Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery and midfielders Bastian Schweinsteiger , David Alaba and Javi Martinez are also sidelined . Bayern boss Pep Guardiola has a long injury list to contend with as he aims for domestic and European glory . Bayern Munich defender Medhi Benatia -LRB- right -RRB- suffered a muscle injury against Bayer Leverkusen . Guardiola had only 14 healthy players at Friday 's practice . The Spaniard said he was not sure ` how long we can live with this situation , ' adding that ` we are tired . ' Bayern need four more wins to secure the Bundesliga title . Guardiola 's team visits Porto on Wednesday . The former Barcelona manager has suggested that his team is shackled by the absence of Ribery and Robben . ` Without Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery , we are a different team , ' Guardiola said after the German Cup semi-final . Ribery -LRB- left -RRB- is absent with an ankle injury while Robben is out until May with a stomach muscle tear . ` Of course we have big problems because we have no players for the one-on-one situations . We have other players and have to adapt the game for them . ' Robben was ruled out for around two months with a stomach muscle tear at the end of March . Ribery has an uncertain timescale on his recovery from an ankle injury but is doubtful for the first leg of Munich 's Champions League quarter-final tie against Porto .
