Manchester City have decided to listen to offers for Yaya Toure and Samir Nasri this summer as the Barclays Premier League champions look to repair the damage of a disastrous title defence . City manager Manuel Pellegrini is under intense scrutiny following Sunday 's 4-2 defeat by neighbours Manchester United . But as the City board refuse to give up on their manager just yet the decision has been made to jettison high-profile players who the club believe have failed them . Manchester City have decided to listen to offers for Ivorian midfielder Yaya Toure this summer . The Premier League champions are also open to allowing Samir Nasri leave the Etihad Stadium . Toure will be made available before his value in the market dwindles . Nasri , meanwhile , has barely played since his lame showing in the Champions League at Barcelona . Defender Aleksandar Kolarov and striker Edin Dzeko are also short of admirers within the club , while midfielder James Milner is out of contract this summer . Toure may be difficult to sell as he earns in excess of Â£ 1million a month . Pellegrini is vulnerable but may be saved by a relatively undemanding fixture list up to the end of the season and by the fact that City 's No 1 choice to replace him , Pep Guardiola , is contracted to Bayern Munich for another year . However , City fear captain Vincent Kompany will miss a few weeks of the run-in with a thigh injury .
