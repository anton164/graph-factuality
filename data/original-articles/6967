Lewis Hamilton led the way in both practice sessions for Sunday 's Chinese Grand Prix . Hamilton suggested Mercedes will be back in control for this race after Ferrari and Sebastian Vettel conjured one of the surprises for many a season with the team 's first victory for almost two years at the last race in Malaysia . Many people expected another dominant Mercedes campaign in the wake of last season 's crushing success and thoroughly convincing win in the opening race in Australia . Lewis Hamilton was fastest in both practice sessions for this weekend 's Chinese Grand Prix . The Briton , mobbed by fans in the paddock , is bidding to win his fourth Chinese Grand Prix . 1 .

Even Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff suggested Ferrari 's success was ` a wake-up call ' to his organisation . Without doubt Mercedes , and Hamilton in particular , responded as he initially finished 0.541 seconds quicker than team-mate Nico Rosberg at the end of FP1 when Pirelli 's medium-compound tyre was used . Switching to the faster soft tyre for runs in FP2 , Hamilton again comfortably had the edge by 0.443 secs over Ferrari 's Kimi Raikkonen . Red Bull 's Daniel Ricciardo was third quickest , 1.093 secs adrift , but only after taking to the track 40 minutes late due to issues . It is yet to be determined whether they were the same problems that ultimately brought an end to team-mate Daniil Kvyat 's day . As the young Russian exited the pits with 20 minutes remaining his brakes caught fire , and although Kvyat attempted to return , he was eventually forced to pull off track . Felipe Massa trudges off the track after his spin brought out the red flags during the second practice session . The Brazilian inspects his Williams after he locked up on the approach to turn 14 before losing the back end . Vettel was fourth on the timesheet , 1.120 secs down , with Rosberg fifth after making a mistake on his fast lap on the soft tyres . Kvyat still ended up sixth , followed by the Williams of Valtteri Bottas , Sauber 's Felipe Nasr and Romain Grosjean in his Lotus . McLaren 's Jenson Button completed the top 10 , two seconds down as he and the team continue to show signs of improvement , with team-mate Fernando Alonso 12th and a further half a second off the pace . Felipe Massa 's session , meanwhile , lasted 38 minutes as the Williams driver skidded off the track at the end of the longest straight in F1 . Daniil Kvyat 's brakes caught fire when he left the pits and the Red Bull driver ended up in the gravel . Fernando Alonso looks on from the back of the McLaren garage ... he ended the second session in 12th . The Brazilian locked up on the approach to turn 14 , losing the back end of the car and resulting in a slide on to the run-off area where he lost the left front-wing endplate after clipping a barrier . Although Massa managed to keep the engine running and reversed his car , the endplate lodged under the left-front tyre , forcing him to abandon . It resulted in the session being red-flagged for the car 's retrieval , with Massa ultimately finishing down in 17th . Manor duo Roberto Merhi and Will Stevens brought up the rear , the latter encountering issues with his power unit in FP2 which restricted him to just six laps . Stevens will be hoping the problem can be resolved as he has already missed qualifying and the race in both Australia and Malaysia due to other difficulties . Sebastian Vettel , winner at the Malaysian Grand Prix last time out , was fourth quickest in the second session .
