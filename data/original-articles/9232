Blamed initially on ` engine failure ' , it emerged on Tuesday that a government jet carrying Serbia 's president to Italy last week was forced to turn back when the co-pilot spilled coffee on the instrument board . Advisers to President Tomislav Nikolic described being ` thrown around the cabin ' when the plane - a 34-year-old French-built Falcon 50 - began tumbling through the air on Friday . The plane landed safely back in Belgrade , but Nikolic was forced to cancel his official visit to meet Pope Francis in the Vatican , and his advisers put the incident down to yet another malfunction on the ageing , incident-prone aircraft . Advisers to President Tomislav Nikolic -LRB- left , pictured in February in Belgrade -RRB- described being ` thrown around the cabin ' when a plane taking him to Italy last week began tumbling through the sky . One adviser told Reuters that she would ` never step foot on that plane again , ' saying the fall had lasted ` for what seemed like an eternity ' . An investigation determined that the co-pilot , Bojan Zoric , had spilled coffee on the instrument board ` due to ongoing turbulence ' . ` I began wiping the board and accidentally activated the 'em ergency slat ' button , ' which automatically turned off the automatic pilot and the plane began losing altitude , Zoric said in the report by Serbia 's Civil Aviation Directorate . The pilot took over command , managed to pull the plane up and sought permission to turn back to Belgrade , Zoric added . He said that one of the engines then stopped working but was restarted on the way back to the airport . The Directorate temporarily suspended Zoric 's licence on Monday . An investigation revealed that the pilot of the Falcon 50 -LRB- file image -RRB- carrying Nikolic spilled coffee on the instrument panel and turned the autopilot off as he wiped it down .
