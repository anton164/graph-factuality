This is the unfortunate moment a twelve tonne double decker bus broke down - and was pushed to safety by the driver and a group of helpful passengers . The massive bus broke down en route to the Stagecoach depot in Dover , Kent , so the unlucky driver was forced to ask passengers , colleagues and locals to give him a helping hand . Around seven proactive members of the public and bus company workers teamed up and managed to move the heavy bus - which weighs the same as two fully-grown African elephants . The 12-tonne double decker bus -LRB- pictured -RRB- broke down on its way to the Stagecoach depot in Dover , Kent - and the unlucky driver was forced to ask passengers , colleagues and locals to give him a helping hand . The group managed to succesfully roll the huge bus - which can carry up to 80 passengers - through the streets and on to the local depot . The moment was captured by Dover resident Stephen Davies last week . Mr Davies , 57 , said : ` It broke down at the traffic lights but fortunately it was only around the corner from the bus depot so all the drivers came round to push it back . ` A few passengers got out to help too . ' The group managed to roll the huge bus - which can carry up to 80 passengers - through the streets of Dover .
