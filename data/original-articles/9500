Aston Villa may be gearing up for an FA Cup semi-final clash against Liverpool on Sunday , but that did n't stop manager Tim Sherwood having some fun during a press conference on Friday . Sherwood showed his softer side during the week when he replied to a letter from six-year-old fan Charlie Pye who had applied for the Villa hotseat after Paul Lambert was sacked in February . The Villa youngster wanted a chocolate bar as a win bonus and would have agreed terms for a signed claret and blue football , a WWE wrestling figure and some sweets - and Sherwood had some fun on Friday as he revealed his ` win bonus ' to the assembled media . Tim Sherwood was quizzed about his letter to young Aston Villa fan Charlie Pye on Friday . Sherwood revealed his ` win bonus ' to the assembled media in reference to Pye 's letter . ` He -LRB- Charlie -RRB- wrote to the club ... he applied for the job when Paul left and I managed to just pip him to the post , ' Sherwood joked . ` I wrote to him and just said no hard feelings ... just unlucky , maybe next time for you . ` He said that he wanted his mum and dad to be the assistant managers and the win bonus would be sweets and chocolate . ' Sherwood then reached down under the desk to reveal a Twix multi-pack . ` He sent me these this morning for my win bonus at Tottenham , so I thank you Charlie for that . ' Pye applied for the role when Paul Lambert was sacked but was pipped to the post by Sherwood .
