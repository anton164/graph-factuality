Malky Mackay 's bid to rescue his managerial career was left in tatters on Monday night after he was sensationally sacked by Wigan Athletic . The 43-year-old was told of the decision during a brief meeting with new chairman David Sharpe after the Latics lost 2-0 at home against Derby County . Mackay was handed the job by former owner Dave Whelan back in November to a backdrop of an FA investigation into a shocking series of text messages , exposed by Sportsmail . Wigan manager Malky Mackay has been sacked after just five months in charge , with Wigan facing relegation . Mackay gesticulates on the touchline during the defeat to Derby County , which would prove to be his last . Cardiff City manager at the time , Mackay is accused of sending racist , sexist and homophobic messages in an exchange with former head of recruitment Iain Moody . The Scot remains under investigation by the FA and Monday 's developments will not alter the speed in which his case is dealt with . Sharpe , 23 , looked forlorn after defeat against Derby and made a snap decision to axe the boss just a month into the new role . It was a result to leave the club eight points off Championship safety with only five games left and the chairman was potentially swayed by terrace chants to sack the manager as goals from Chris Martin and Darren Bent plunged Wigan closer to relegation . They must win their next two games against Fulham and Millwall to stand any chance of survival . Although Wigan did not announce a caretaker manager , such was the haste of Sharpe 's decision , Gary Caldwell is expected to be handed the job on a temporary basis . Hibernian manager Alan Stubbs is highly thought of . John Doolan , who formed part of Uwe Rosler 's backroom staff at Wigan , is first team coach to Stubbs . Ex-player Danny Wilson presents another option . Mackay won just five of his 25 fixtures in charge and picked up only three home points - damning statistics referenced in the club 's official statement last night . Sharpe said : ` This is a very difficult decision to make but I feel that , for the long-term future of the club , there needs to be a change now . ' Sportsmail understands Mackay was close to suffering the sack back in February but victory away at Reading granted him a stay of execution . Wigan were content with keeping their boss until at least the end of the season and had faith in the divisive figure . Sources at the DW Stadium also indicated that Mackay was ready to build a similar recruitment structure to that at Cardiff and had been sanctioned to do so . He remained defiant that they could stay in the division immediately after losing against Derby : ` It 's still mathematically possible . I 've got a team there which is putting performances in every week . It 's fine lines between winning and losing in this league .
