Dick Advocaat has serious concerns over the strength of Sunderland 's players ahead of their relegation run-in . The Black Cats are two places and three points above the drop zone but have won just one in nine and end their season with trips to Arsenal and Chelsea . It has left them as odds-on with some bookmakers to finish inside the bottom three come May 24 . Sunderland manager Dick Advocaat has concerns about the physical strength of his players . Advocaat has never been relegated during 28 years as a manager but admits he is worried about that record having watched Sunderland slump to a 4-1 defeat at home to Crystal Palace on Saturday . Next up is a trip to Stoke City and the Dutch boss fears his team lacks the muscle for such a test . ` We are not a real physical team , ' said the 67-year-old . ` If you compare us with the other teams , that 's a big difference . ` In the Premier League , you need physical players as well . We have to think about that for the game with Stoke City . Sunderland were beaten 4-1 by Crystal Palace on Saturday and are three points above the relegation zone . ` We have different type of players , who are more combination players , than with more pace . ` We have to find a combination to create chances and win games . We can not complain to each other . You win games together , you lose games together . ` They also know they played badly in the second half against Crystal Palace . The way we gave the goals away was very poor . ` But we have to do it with this squad , and we will do it with this squad . '
