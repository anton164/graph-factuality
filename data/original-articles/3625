Peter Scudamore rode an incredible 1,678 winners but has seen his achievements dwarfed by AP McCoy . Here , he identifies what he believes are the 10 finest achievements of Saturday 's retiring champion . 1 RIDING HIS 4,000 th WINNER AT TOWCESTER ON NOVEMBER 7 , 2013 . He has won virtually every big race in the calendar but McCoy 's greatest feat has to be the immense tally of winners he has ridden . To put his numbers into perspective , in the all-time list of successful jockeys , great rival Richard Johnson is closest to him and the gap is around 1,500 winners . Tony McCoy celebrating after he won his 4,000 th race on board Mountain Tune at Wetherby in 2013 . 2 HIS 20 STRAIGHT JUMP JOCKEY TITLES . If you like your champions dominant , you have to love McCoy . No modern sportsman can match his reign . He outstrips 16-time darts world champion Phil Taylor by almost 200 weeks , with a staggering 1,040 weeks at the top . That compares to 364 for Formula One 's Michael Schumacher and 302 for tennis ace Roger Federer . 3 WINNING THE 1994-95 CONDITIONAL JOCKEYS CHAMPIONSHIP . McCoy hit the ground running on his arrival in Britain from Ireland , landing the apprentice title for jumps jockeys with a record 74 wins . Not surprisingly , it is another McCoy record which still stands . 4 RECORD 290 WINNERS IN A SEASON -LRB- 2001-02 -RRB- . The 300-winner season McCoy craved proved too much even for him but he got close with 289 in Britain and one abroad . His feat outstripped the European record of German Peter Schiergen -LRB- 271 in 1995 -RRB- and Sir Gordon Richards ' best of 269 in 1947 . 5 WINNING BBC SPORTS PERSONALITY OF THE YEAR IN 2010 . Not to be underestimated . Frankie Dettori and Lester Piggott are household names but neither of those great jockeys won this prestigious title . McCoy 's prodigious achievements have transcended racing 's usual boundaries and his peerless career has gained the respect it deserves . McCoy stands proud with his Sport Personality of the Year Award in Birmingham in 2010 . 6 DO N'T PUSH IT 'S 2010 GRAND NATIONAL WIN . Picking out even a handful of McCoy 's best wins is an exercise in subjective futility . We all have our favourites but Do n't Push It 's victory at Aintree was arguably the most significant on the greatest stage . Plenty of top jockeys have never had a sniff of the Grand National winner 's enclosure . McCoy celebrates aboard Grand National winner Do n't Push It at Aintree racecourse in 2013 . 7 WORTH HIS WEIGHT . Unbelievably , given the lengths to which he has gone to control his weight and boil himself down , McCoy has never had to put up overweight -LRB- carry more than his mount was allotted -RRB- . It is another example of his extraordinary self control . 8 BREAKING MY FASTEST TIME TO 100 WINNERS IN A SEASON . I never thought my fastest-to-100-wins record would stand forever but in November 1996 McCoy thrashed my best by 30 days . A season later and he beat his own record by 16 days . This season he set a new best for a fastest ton on August 21 , 116 days into the season . McCoy achieved the fastest ever century of jumping winners at Warwick in 1996 on board Class of 92 . 9 NOT JUST THE WIDTH , FEEL THE QUALITY . He has not had the consistent big-race firepower of compatriot Ruby Walsh but 31 winners at the Cheltenham Festival is still an amazing tally for McCoy and includes three Champion Hurdles and two Gold Cups . To put that in perspective , John Francome only had 10 Festival wins and Richard Dunwoody 18 , while I had 13 . In all , he rode 196 wins at Cheltenham . 10 THE WORCESTER SOURCE . McCoy has ridden more winners at Worcester -- 298 from 1,089 rides -- than at any course in Britain and the venue , while not individually significant , is symbolic . It shows what a force of energy he has been at the mundane weekly meetings . Never has his motivation dropped , no matter how small the stage . It is a trait which set him apart . McCoy has ridden more winners at Worcester , 298 from 1,089 rides , than at any course in Britain .
