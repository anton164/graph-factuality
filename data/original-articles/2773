Paul Gregory , 51 , of Bedford , has been fined £ 795 for having a blue badge , claiming he could only walk 200 metres , when in fact he was a keen walker . A disability badge holder who claimed he could only walk 200 metres ended up in court after council officials noticed a newspaper report recounting his exploits on a 191-mile hike . When Paul Gregory , 51 , applied to renew his blue badge , he claimed exercise left him breathless , despite being a keen walker and member of a mountaineering club . He was exposed when Bedford Borough Council staff read an article in The Westmorland Gazette , describing how the ` experienced walker ' had been attacked by cows in Cumbria on the third day of a hike in 2012 . The article , which featured a picture of him dressed in walking gear , told how he was knocked over by four cows in a field at the edge of Shap in Cumbria . The council also found he had spent a weekend walking in Wales days before making a blue badge application . Gregory , of Bedford , pleaded guilty to two counts of dishonestly obtaining a blue badge by misrepresenting his physical abilities at Luton Magistrates ' Court . He was fined £ 795 , ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work and pay a £ 60 victim surcharge . He was also subject to a one year supervision order and told to undergo 19 sessions of ` thinking skills ' . A Bedford Borough Council spokesman said it was one of the ` most outrageous cases ' of blue badge fraud it had investigated . He said : ` He was taking part in national walking trips that many able-bodied adults would find difficult . ` Mr Gregory 's abuse of the scheme is completely unacceptable and we will continue to investigate all reports of blue badge fraud thoroughly . ' Gregory was fined £ 795 and ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work when he admitted dishonestly obtaining a blue badge by misrepresenting his physical abilities at Luton Magistrates ' Court -LRB- pictured -RRB- .
