Manchester City and Chelsea are set to battle it out for the signature of West Ham left-back Aaron Cresswell this summer . Cresswell has impressed for the Hammers this campaign and City are desperate to add to their quota of English players with the likes of James Milner on the brink of leaving the club . City will have another chance to run the rule over the 25-year-old when West Ham travel to the Etihad this Sunday . Chelsea and Manchester City are set to battle it out for West Ham left back Aaron Cresswell this summer . The 25-year-old has impressed during his first season in the Premier League since leaving Ipswich . West Ham snapped up Cresswell for Â£ 2million from Ipswich last summer but he has adapted to the top tier with relative ease and attracted the eye of the division 's Champions League clubs . Chelsea , mindful of their own number of English players , are also interested in Cresswell . With Cesar Azpilicueta installed as first choice left-back , the Blues see Cresswell as a homegrown alternative to Filipe Luis , frustrated with his lack of opportunities since arriving last summer . The Upton Park hierarchy would be reluctant to sell Cresswell , who is on a five-year deal in east London . Tottenham full back Danny Rose is also under consideration from City as they bid to boost homegrown quota . Manchester City also want Liverpool contract rebel Raheem Sterling and are preparing a summer bid . Tottenham 's Danny Rose is also on City 's radar for the left-back role with Aleksandar Kolorov set to be among a large Etihad exodus in the close season . England stars Jack Wilshere , Jordan Henderson and Liverpool contract rebel Raheem Sterling are also on City 's wanted list to fulfil the quota . Premier League sides must name eight homegrown players in their 25-man squad registered at the beginning of the season . A player is deemed homegrown if they have spent at least three years at any English club before the age of 21 , regardless of nationality .
