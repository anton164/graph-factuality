Interested parties have begun due diligence on West Brom as the sale of the club edges closer . The Baggies are on the market with chairman Jeremy Peace understood to want between £ 150million and £ 200million for the club . Groups from America , Australia and the Far East are believed to be interested in buying Albion after Peace confirmed he would be open to offers in February . West Brom chairman Jeremy Peace is hoping to sell the club for between £ 150million and £ 200million . Manager Tony Pulis has been assured that the deal will be done by July , so as not to affect pre-season . He has set a July deadline to complete any deal to ensure it does not drag out and hamper their summer transfer plans under head coach Tony Pulis . Should he fail to sell the club , though , then Peace , who has been chairman for 13 years , will remain committed to Albion , who are on course to seal a sixth straight season in the Barclays Premier League . Pulis said on Monday he was unaware of any imminent sale but Peace has given him assurances it will not drag on over the summer . Any due diligence of the Hawthorns club is likely to be helped after they announced pre-tax profits of £ 14.7 million up to end of June 2014 in February . The Baggies are 13th in the Barclays Premier League , seven points clear of the relegation zone , with four games left and go to Manchester United on Saturday . Pulis has led West Brom to 13th in the Premier League after taking over when they were in danger of relegation .
