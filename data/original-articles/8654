Police said the man 's legs had been chopped off and put inside the trunk , while his partner was found wearing a set of glass bangles traditionally worn by newlywed women . Macabre : The naked bodies of a young couple are found stuffed in boxes in a northern Indian state , the suspected victims of an honour killing . ` It appears they were strangulated and dumped here later . They are yet to be identified , ' the chief investigating officer , Praveen Kumar , told AFP . ` It seems like a case of honour killing because the woman is wearing wedding bangles but we are not ruling out other motives , ' he added . India has witnessed honour killings - where couples are targeted because their families or communities disapprove of their relationships - for centuries , especially in rural areas . They are carried out by close relatives or village elders to protect what is seen as the family 's reputation and pride in a hereditary-based caste system . The latest incident comes two days after Haryana police arrested a man and his son for killing his teenage daughter over an inter-caste relationship with a boy . In 2013 , a man was beheaded and his wife was killed by her own family for eloping within the same clan . Locals discovered the dead pair , believed to be in their mid to late 20s , in separate metal trunks in a public park in Haryana state , around 30 miles south of New Delhi .
