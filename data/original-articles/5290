This is the amazing scene as a freelance photographer risks his life to capture an image of a hungry lion from just a few feet away . Fearless Atif Saeed , 38 , from Lahore , Pakistan was in the city 's safari park when he spotted the male lion in the distance . Mr Saeed got out of his car and crept up towards the hunter armed only with a camera and fired off a few frames . Atif Saeed crept to within 10 feet of the hungry lion before leaving the safety of his car to lie on the ground . Armed only with a camera , Mr Saeed , managed to capture a couple of frames before retreating to safety . Unfortunately , the clicking sound of the camera 's shutter alerted the lion to Mr Saeed 's presence , who was forced to retreat quite rapidly from just 10 feet away from the lion . He said : ` I was sitting in front of him just near my car and the door of my car was open . I was sat on ground few feet away , so he was treating me like his prey . ` I was thinking - I must show the character and status of lion and this was the only way I could think of to achieve this . ` The story finished in few seconds as the lion aggressively jumped towards me and I just about scrambled into my car . ' was laughing at that time , but now when I think back about the incident I do n't think I would be able to do it again . It was a pretty close encounter . '
