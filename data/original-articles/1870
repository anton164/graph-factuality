Ben Stokes thought he had claimed his 23rd Test wicket when Jermaine Blackwood slashed his short delivery straight to Alastair Cook at slip . But the Durham all-rounder 's front foot had crossed the line and the batsman earned a reprieve . It 's not the first time this has happened to Stokes , of course -- a similar error saw him denied his first Test wicket against Australia in Adelaide in 2013 . Ben Stokes was denied the wicket of Jermaine Blackwood after overstepping the crease . Stokes overstepped the line when he thought he had England 's fifth wicket of the day in Antigua . Stokes celebrated wildly when Brad Haddin was caught behind on that occasion , and the pair clashed when the decision was overturned . Michael Vaughan , while commentating on BBC 's Test Match Special , thinks the 23-year-old should return to his natural style of bowling . ` Stokes is trying to be a very English-type bowler , ' Vaughan said . ` But when I 've seen him bowl really well , I 've seen him bowl short spells : really fast , with lots of bouncers . ' England gather in celebration of Stokes ' wicket , only for it to be overturned by the umpire . Vaughan 's BBC colleague , Jonathan Agnew , thinks England will rue Tuesday 's showing . ` England will look back on today as a missed opportunity in terms of batting , ' he said . ` They still have the advantage , they 've kept chipping away with wickets and they 've kept things very tight , but they could have done with that Blackwood wicket .
