Husband Jeff , 26 , was on hand to capture the incredible moment using his underwater camera . Stunning : Tori Hester was diving off the coast of Mexico when the school of fish began circling above her . ` Today , the biomass is booming and the ecosystem is returning to a healthy state which is how we managed to witness this incredible sight , ' Jeff explained . Jeff , a marine scientist , said : ` We arrived in Cabo Pulmo , a tiny town made up of dirt roads with a population right around 100 , not really sure what to expect , but had heard some pretty amazing stories about the place . ' ` We were swimming along and saw a small band of Jacks heading away from us , so we followed them , ' he explained . ` That small band slowly grew bigger and bigger , until out of the distance , this massive fish tornado appeared . ` I was awe-struck . I had never seen anything like that before in my life . ' Tori 's husband Jeff , a marine scientist , was on hand to capture the moment using his underwater camera . He added : ` It was such a productive ecosystem , with not only a large quantity of fish , but a wide diversity of organisms as well . ` I believe this is what our oceans should look like , this is why I was I was drawn to make this image . ' But Jeff explained that Cabo Pulmo had n't always been like this . In 1995 , a marine park was established by residents to tackle the problem of overfishing . ` Today , the biomass is booming and the ecosystem is returning to a healthy state which is how we managed to witness this incredible sight , ' he explained .
