A South American president appears to have fallen for the oldest trick in the book after unwittingly posing for a photo next to a child wearing an ` I 'm With Stupid ' T-shirt . Ecuador 's leader Rafael Correa was pictured with his arm around the boy - seemingly oblivious to the message on the shirt and the large arrow that was pointing in his direction . The casually-dressed 52-year-old is said to be able to speak fluent English - but seemingly failed to pick up the meaning of the T-shirt . Ecuador 's leader Rafael Correa -LRB- right -RRB- posed for a picture next to a boy wearing an ` I 'm With Stupid ' T-shirt . The picture was shared thousands of times on social media networks in the country . It is now trending with the hashtag #IAmWithStupidMashi , referring to the official Twitter account of the president @MashiRafael . It also prompted thousands of comments including the suggestion that the child was a CIA agent brought in to damage the president 's reputation . The phjoto was shared thousands of times and prompted a series of fake pictures , including the one above . However , his supporters quickly rallied behind him and used the hashtag #WeAreWithYouMashi to fight back . According to the BBC , the boy 's mother said that her son had not known the meaning of the T-shirt himself and she is quoted as saying : ` We do n't want to shame the president ' . Correa , who was first elected in 2006 , is popular among Ecuadorians for his government 's social spending but has also faced criticism for intolerance of dissent .
