The NFL is set to hire Sarah Thomas as its first permanent female official for regular season games , according to reports . The 42-year-old mother-of-three from Mississippi has officiated pre-season games as a line judge . The Baltimore Sun 's Aaron Wilson broke the story , with the NFL refusing to confirm the appointment . The Los Angeles Times reported that Thomas will be one of eight new officials for the 2015 season . Sarah Thomas is set to become the NFL 's first full-time female official after refereeing college games . Thomas was on the NFL 's list of officiating prospects and is set to be named as one of eight new officials . Thomas has a history of trailblazing since beginning her refereeing career in 1999 . Starting at high school level , she would go on to become the first woman to referee in a Big Ten stadium and a bowl game . ` She has the right temperament and attitude and feel for the game , ' a source told The Baltimore Sun . ` She knows the rules and understands how to apply them in the spirit of the rules . That sets her apart , male or female . ' ` I set out to do this and get involved in officiating not having any idea that there were not any females officiating football , ' Thomas told NFL Network . ` Being a former basketball player , you saw female officiating all the time . So , no , I do n't feel like a pioneer . ' In 2012 , Shannon Eastin was hired during an officiating lockout and was line judge during the regular season game between the Green Bay Packers and the St Louis Rams . She was not hired permanently , however .
