Scroll down for video . Indonesian President Joko Widodo -LRB- left -RRB- ignored reassurances from his chief political rival Prabowo Subianto -LRB- right -RRB- that he would support a decision to grant clemency to Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran . Former Indonesian army general Prabowo Subianto twice privately assured Mr Joko there would be no political consequences if the Bali Nine ringleaders and others on death row were reprieved . Independent senator Nick Xenophon said he was told earlier in the year by human rights advocates that Mr Prabowo - who narrowly lost the presidential elections to Mr Joko in October - was ` very sympathetic ' to clemency . As well , he could see that the executions of Chan and Sukumaran could damage relations between Australia and Indonesia . ` I was advised at the time that it would be a bad idea to approach him , so I did n't , ' Senator Xenophon told ABC radio . ` One view was that it would enrage President Widodo and make matters worse , and I guess we 'll never know . ' This comes after a senior Indonesian government official praised the firing squad that executed Bali Nine pair and six other convicted drug traffickers . ABC News reports that Indonesian attorney-general H.M. Prasetyo applauded Chan and Sukumaran 's executioners for their work . ` All shots were done perfectly . These executions were carried out smoothly and in order - much better than the first round of executions in January , ' he said . Indonesian president Joko Widodo failed to return Australian PM Tony Abbott 's phone calls about the Bali Nine in March . Indonesian attorney-general H.M. Prasetyo -LRB- right -RRB- applauded Chan and Sukumaran 's executioners for the good job that they did . Mr Prasetyo declared it was necessary to fight drug crime in the country , as he dismissed Australia 's withdrawal of its ambassador as a ` momentary reaction ' . He visited Nusakambangan on Wednesday , hours after Bali Nine pair were executed with other drug offenders . ` I would like to say that an execution is not a pleasant thing . It is not a fun job , ' he said . ` But we must do it in order to save the nation from the danger of drugs . We are not making enemies of counties from where those executed came . What we are fighting against is drug-related crimes . ` Therefore , I would like to offer my condolences , on the execution of those who were on the death row , to their families , to their home countries . ` Once again , we are not against the countries , but we are fighting a war against the horrible drug crimes that threaten our nation 's survival . ' Mr Prasetyo -LRB- second right -RRB- said that ` all the shots were done perfectly ' at the execution . The Indonesian attorney-general believed that Wednesday morning 's execution was much better than one carried out in January . Mr Prasetyo shrugged off diplomatic backlash from Australia after Prime Minister Tony Abbott slammed the executions as ` cruel and unnecessary ' and announced he would withdraw Australia 's ambassador to Indonesia Paul Grigson . ` The Netherlands have done the same thing in the past . Brazil has done the same thing , ' he said . ` I think this is just a momentary reaction , and this will be settled within the diplomatic sphere . ' Indonesia 's Vice President Jusuf Kalla said withdrawing an ambassador was a normal diplomatic protest . ` Within a month or two , they will come back . That 's the signal of protest , we did that too , ' he said , referring to the time Indonesia withdrew its ambassador to Australia in 2013 over a phone tapping scandal . Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Australia will withdraw its ambassador to Indonesia in an unprecedented diplomatic response to the executions of Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan . Rest in peace : Myuran Sukumaran -LRB- foreground -RRB- and Andrew Chan -LRB- back -RRB- were executed . Prasetyo said the executions would serve as a warning to others . ` This is a warning for others , do n't even try to commit these drug crimes , to think a thousand times , that Indonesia will be strict , will be harsh on drug crimes , ' he told reporters in Cilacap . ` The result of the second execution was better , more orderly and more perfect than the last , ' he said , referring to executions carried out in January and noting the bodies were treated more ` humanely ' this time . Indonesia 's President Joko Widodo raised his nation 's sovereignty when asked about Australia withdrawing its ambassador . ` Our sovereignty must be respected , ' he told reporters . ` We 're ready to respect the sovereignty of other countries as well . ' Australia 's ambassador to Indonesia Paul Grigson will return to Australia at the end of this week . Foreign Minister Julie Bishop -LRB- left -RRB- said Australian consular officials in Indonesia will arrange for the men 's bodies to be repatriated to Australia , ensuring that they are treated with ` appropriate dignity and respect ' Joko Widodo , the president of Indonesia , is widely regarded as weak . He has ignored international pressure to cease executions of foreign drug convicts .
