Manchester City are monitoring Juventus striker Alvaro Morata . The Spain international was a target for Arsenal a year ago when he left Real Madrid but opted for a move to Italy instead . Real have a buy-back option set at around Â£ 15million but are unlikely to take that up . Manchester City are keeping tabs on Juventus striker Alvaro Morata ahead of possible summer bid . Morata closes down Lazio goalkeeper Federico Marchetti during Juve 's Serie A win on Saturday . City also remain keen on Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba but face competition from Paris Saint Germain . Morata has been a success at Juventus but the Italians are always susceptible to offers at the right price and are making plans to bring in Edinson Cavani from Paris Saint Germain despite the French club 's resistance . PSG also are one of the frontrunners to sign Juve midfielder Paul Pogba . City remain one of the clubs pushing to sign the France international too and Juventus have City 's Edin Dzeko , Aleksandar Kolarov and Stevan Jovetic on their list of potential targets for the summer .
