Hollywood star Robert Downey Jnr stormed out of a TV interview when asked about his history of drug abuse and time in prison . The actor was furious when the line of questioning suddenly got personal in a recorded chat with Channel 4 in London to promote his new film Avengers : Age of Ultron . He had been on good form when the exchange started - in which , as arranged , he would discuss his experiences on the new blockbuster which premiered in Britain on Tuesday . But he could be seen getting visibly uncomfortable when interviewer Krishnan Guru-Murthy began asking about his long-conquered personal demons . Scroll down for video . Calling time : During an interview for Avengers : Age of Ultron , Robert Downey Jnr left mid-way through . He 's off : When asked about his relationship with his father , Downey Jnr gets up and says : ` I 'm sorry , I really do n't ... what are we doing ? ' before walking out . ` It 's all getting very Diane Sawyer in here ' : Robert clearly did n't appreciate the line of questioning . Did n't go according to plan , Krishnan ? The Channel 4 news presenter was left visibly embarrassed . Specifically , the news anchor asked Downey Jr to explain a comment in a five year-old interview with the New York Times , in which he said : ` You ca n't go from a $ 2,000-a-night suite at La Mirage to a penitentiary and really understand it and come out a liberal . ' Responding , Downey Jr , 50 , said : ` I could pick that apart for two hours and be no closer to the truth than giving you some half-arsed answer right now . I could n't even tell you what a liberal is . ' But , when asked about his relationship with his father , Downey Jnr gets up and says : ` I 'm sorry , I really do n't ... what are we doing ? ' before walking out of the interview . Seemingly amused with the reaction , Guru-Murthy can be seen smiling and gesticulating as a production team-member tried to remove Robert 's clip-on microphone . At that point he turns and says : ` It 's all getting a bit Diane Sawyer -LSB- a U.S. journalist known for her investigative interviewing -RSB- . ' Off to a good start : Downey Jr was charming as the exchange started - in which , as arranged , he would discuss his experiences on the new blockbuster , which premiered in London on Tuesday . Getting personal : But when Guru-Murthy asked questions about his long-conquered personal demons , the star could be seen getting visibly uncomfortable . Clearly wanting to keep a dignified silence on the matter , the veteran star - who originates from Manhattan and has battled both drug addiction and prison - resisted the temptation to make reference to the incident on Twitter . Unlike him , however , Krishnan twice shared details - captioning one video ` A steely moment from Ironman ' . But viewers were n't impressed , with nearly three-hundred ` disliking ' it within hours . Tellingly , the comments which followed shared a similar opinion . One wrote : ` God , Krish you can be an a -- . When your interviewee is uncomfortable , do n't keep pressing them . Props to RDJ for ending it . ' Another simply said : ` No class at all .

Quentin Tarantino . Robert Downey Jr is not the first Hollywood star to be upset by Krishnan Guru-Murthy 's interview technique - last year director Quentin Tarantino also objected to his line of questioning .

Turning around to look for her publicist , a confused and annoyed Blanchett fired back : ` That 's your question ? That 's your f ****** question ?
