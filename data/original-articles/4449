A New York taxi driver has been ordered to pay a lesbian couple $ 10,000 in damages after he told them to stop kissing in the back of his cab . Mohammed Dahbi discriminated against actress Kassie Thornton and her TV executive partner Christy Spitzer after ordering them to ` keep that behavior for the bedroom ' . He warned that if they ignored his request during the trip on September 18 , 2011 , he would throw them out . Outraged : Mohammed Dahbi was accused of discrimination after ordering actress Kassie Thornton and her TV executive partner Christy Spitzer to stop kissing and ` keep that behavior for the bedroom ' . He was ordered to pay the couple $ 10,000 in fines . When they got out , Dahbi also called the pair ` b ***** ' , ` c **** ' and ` whores ' after they refused to pay the fare and walked away . He claimed during the city 's Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings they were ` touching each other all over ' and ` kissing heavily ' . But according to DNAinfo New York , Judge John Spooner disagreed and ordered him to pay the fine . He also made him attend anti-discrimination training and pay a $ 5,000 civil penalty to the city . Ms Spitzer told the news website : ` We felt that what happened to us was wrong and he needed to take responsibility for his actions . The trip began at Columbus Circle when Ms Spizter climbed into the yellow cab with her dog and headed to pick Ms Thronton up in Chelsea , before heading to Sunset Park in Brooklyn . However , when they hit the Meatpacking District , Dahbi turned around and barked the orders at them . Verbal abuse : When the pair -LRB- pictured -RRB- got out , Dahbi also called them ` b ***** ' , ` c **** ' and ` whores ' after they refused to pay the fare and walked away . They said he was discriminating against them because they were gay , to which he replied : ` Do n't make me out to be an a ** hole . ' They insist it was just a peck on the lips . Spizter told DNAinfo she knew this because she had just been to the dentist . She said : ` That 's why I 'm so aware of what my behavior was in the taxi . ' Dahbi 's lawyer , Ali Najmi said he had never mentioned anything about the pair 's sexuality and has a ` standard of decency ' . They are now planning to appeal the decision . In a statement on his firm 's website , he said : ` We will be pursuing an appeal of this decision . The Administrative Judge acted unreasonably and made conclusions of fact that can not be substantiated based on the record . The fine amount is completely unfair given that there was no real injury here . '
