Bayern Munich ace Robben has missed his side 's last four matches due an abdominal injury . The former Chelsea star , speaking to Bild , said : ` You always want to be on the pitch to help your team , but you can only watch them when you 're injured . That is the worst situation for a footballer . ` I 've had a lot of injuries in my career , but this is something new - I 've never had something like this before . With this kind of an injury , you 're physically disabled . ` In everyday life , there 's so much you do that requires a working abdominal muscle . You 're not able to get up , sit down or go going to toilet - you 're always in pain . Robben has been working hard in the gym as he prepares for his Bayern Munich return .

I can ride a bicycle and , in a few days , I hope that I can go running a little bit . ` I 'm working hard for my comeback , though nobody can say when that will be . Personally , I hope that my comeback will be in the DFB-Pokal semi-final against Borussia Dortmund on April 28 . '
