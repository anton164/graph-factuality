A motorway police patrol pulled over a car on suspicion of attempting to go back in time . Officers of the Central Motorway Police Group -LRB- CMPG -RRB- spotted the Delorean - a replica of the car used in the Back to the Future films - being carried on the back of a tranpsporter between Stoke-on-Trent and Crewe yesterday morning . Officers who pulled over the famous car tweeted : ` Look what I 've just stopped on the A500 . There is no escaping us no matter where you are in space time ! @UKTimeMachine . ' Police officers photographed the famous car as it travelled between Stoke-on-Trent and Crewe yesterday . Officers joked that the futuristic-looking car from the 1980s had a ` leaky flux capacitor ' from the movie . The car 's interior even had a multi-coloured hat similar to the one used by Marty McFly in the hit movie . They further joked that they had pulled the car over because it had a ` leaking flux capacitor ! And he had set the Tarmac on fire ! @HighwaysEngland wo n't be happy ! ' The futuristic looking Delorean , which was built in Belfast , is hired out for promotional events , weddings and birthdays . The looks almost the same as the movie prop . Joining the fun , the owner of the vehicle , who calls themselves ` Doc Brown ' replied ' @CMPG I was just asking for directions to Hill Valley 1985 ' . Luckily for the the driver , the truck carrying the classic car was not travelling at 88mph and was allowed to continue on its journey . The Back to the Future trilogy featuring Michael J Fox was a massive hit between 1985 and 1990 making almost Â£ 750 million .
