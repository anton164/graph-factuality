Tottenham are ready to grant Emmanuel Adebayor a free transfer , in an attempt to finally get the striker off their wage bill . The Togolese 's move to Spurs has proved a massive financial burden for the north London club , who pay the forward £ 100,000-per-week . Although , the club would still preferably receive a fee for the striker , it may prove difficult to find a potential buyer . Emmanuel Adebayor -LRB- left -RRB- could be allowed to leave the club on a free transfer in the summer . As revealed by Sportsmail on April 1 , the club 's chairman Daniel Levy will subsidies Adebayor 's wages to ensure he leaves this summer knowing potential suitors will not meet his current £ 5.2million-per-season salary . And to make his path out of White Hart Lane even clearer , the club are willing to grant the former Arsenal man a free transfer as an extra sweetener for prospective buyers , despite the fact he will still have a season left on his contract . Tottenham would still like to receive a fee for the striker but they just want rid of his massive wages . The 31-year-old is on the peripheries of Mauricio Pochettino 's plans and is highly unlikely to be granted a route back in . Tottenham are determined to offload the striker this summer , but know they 'll have to take a financial hit to do so . Adebayor has n't been a regular under Mauricio Pochettino and is looking to leave the north London club .
