The 14-time major champion is bidding to win his fifth green jacket , but has been plagued by a succession of injuries and even the chipping yips in recent times . The world will find out which version of Woods will turn up when he tees off in the penultimate group at 6.48 pm . Defending champion Bubba Watson , hoping to win his third Masters title in four years , will tee off at 2.24 pm alongside England 's former US Open champion Justin Rose and 21-year-old South Korean amateur Gunn Yang , who earned the right to play in the prestigious group by winning the US Amateur last year . Those watching the 2.02 pm group on Thursday could see some fireworks as two of the game 's most colourful characters go head-to-head . Ian Poulter could hardly be described as a shrinking violet , but even he might meet his match in American young gun Patrick Reed , who earned himself a brash reputation by professing himself to be among the top five players in the world after his big win at Doral last year . He followed that up by shushing the home crowd during a cocksure display at Gleneagles . Three-time Masters champion Phil MIckelson , hitting from behind trees during practice , will play alongside McIlroy in the first two rounds . Ryan Moore , pictured during a practice round at Augusta , will join McIlroy and Mickelson on the course for round one and two . Woods will be accompanied with Wales ' Jamie Donaldson and Jimmy Walker of the USA during the first two rounds of the competition . US Open champion Martin Kaymer is in the group behind world No 1 McIlroy , with Brandt Snedeker and Houston Open winner JB Holmes . McIlroy and Mickelson were among the players battling for the US PGA title in near-darkness at Valhalla last year , with Mickelson and Rickie Fowler stepping aside on the 18th to allow the final group of McIlroy and Bernd Wiesberger to tee off and beat the fading light . With 98 players in the field , Charley Hoffman and Brian Harman make up the first group out in the tournament proper at 12.45 pm -LRB- 7:45 am local time -RRB- , with Gary Player and Jack Nicklaus again acting as honorary starters five minutes earlier , the legendary duo hitting tee shots on the par-four first before retiring to the clubhouse while Arnold Palmer takes up a similar role but is unable to tee off as he is recovering from a dislocated shoulder . England 's Danny Willett will begin his Masters debut in the second group at 12:56 pm alongside 1987 winner Larry Mize and US amateur public links champion Byron Meth . Woods faces a lengthy wait before he can begin his bid for a fifth Masters title after being drawn in the penultimate group for the opening round . The American superstar has started just two events in 2015 , carding a career-worst 82 to miss the cut in the first and withdrawing through injury after 11 holes of the second , but said he was ready to ` compete to win a golf tournament ' after 11 holes of practice on Monday . The final group tees off at 1:59 pm and features three players ranked in the top 13 in the world , Australia 's Jason Day , Spain 's Sergio Garcia and Fowler . Fowler finished in the top five in all four majors last year .
