Talk about a chain reaction ! This is the moment a billiards player performs a complex trick shot by setting up a domino train to pot four balls . Video footage shows a white ball being rolled down a positioned cue . It then bounces off one side of the red-clothed table and hits the first in a long line of dominoes . One by one the small counters fall down , tapping balls into various pockets as they go . First a yellow , then a blue , then a red . Finally , the last domino gently hits an orange ball , causing it to roll down another positioned cue lying on the table . The orb then knocks a green ball into the center pocket . In less than 30 seconds the stunt comes to a close . The clip was uploaded by YouTube user honda4ridered .
