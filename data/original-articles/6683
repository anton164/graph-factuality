Every year a trend comes around that strikes fear into the hearts of women . Whether it is Crocs , hotpants or UGG boots , everyone has their Achilles heel and this summer many will be concerned about the arrival of the septum piercing . In recent months , a whole host of stars have been wearing the body jewellery , including FKA Twigs , Rihanna and Lady Gaga . FKA Twigs has been one of the main trendsetters when it comes to the septum ring . The septum ring is n't a new trend - the process of piercing the wall between the two nostrils has been done for years . It was a coming-of-age ritual for some North American tribes - the boys would be given the nose ring when they became a man , the Shawnee leaders Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa both had them . In certain warrior tribes , it was used in a similar way to war paint - to look terrifying in front of opponents . In Australia , Aboriginals used the piercing to try and flatten their nose , which they believed made them look more attractive . Lady Gaga -LRB- left -RRB- and Lourdes Leon -LRB- right -RRB- have both adopted the trend . It girl Pixie Geldof wears a simple silver septum ring . Rihanna wears an outlandish septum ring and offsets the look with a 90s bucket hat . In India , and Bangladesh septum piercings are still very popular with women - many Bengali women wear it to show they are married , although this practice is being increasingly replaced with a nose stud . In Nepal , it is often used as a status symbol . The septum ring , which is also known as the ` bull-ring piercing , ' is also used as a way of controlling and handling bulls . But in the UK , America and Australia , it is mainly used as a fashion trend and to create a hippy or rebellious look .
