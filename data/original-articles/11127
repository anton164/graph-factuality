Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville has laid into referee Lee Mason after he failed to award Newcastle a penalty during their 2-0 defeat at Liverpool on Monday night . An incident in the 38th minute of the game , saw Ayoze Perez felled by a reckless challenge from Dejan Lovren . Although replays clearly showed the defender scything Perez down and not making contact with the ball , Mason did not point to the spot . Neville said during his analysis , ` It was an absolute stonewall penalty . The gasp in the ground , Lovren just kicks him right in the knee . ' Ayoze Perez drives into the Liverpool box on 38 minutes only to be brought down by Dejan Lovren . Lovren makes a rash challenge and does not make any contact with the ball , sending the Spaniard tumbling . Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville could not believe that a spot kick was not awarded to the Magpies at Anfield . He added that Mason 's perfect positioning should have led him to make the correct call . ` I think we said it last week , in the game , we always look at the ref 's position . But you look at Lee Mason 's view of it and he 's got no excuse , he 's staring right at it there , he 's so close , within five or six yards . It 's just a poor decision . ' Before Lovren 's foul , Raheem Sterling had put Liverpool in front with a curling effort just inside the box on 9 minutes ; and Joe Allen wrapped up the three points for the home side with a rifled shot into the roof of the net late on following a failed clearance from Mike Williamson . The misery was only to be compounded for Newcastle , as stand-in captain Moussa Sissoko saw red for a second bookable offence . With Newcastle trailing 1-0 , a penalty could have offered them a way back into the game , but nothing was given .
