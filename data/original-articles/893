Would you feel better about gauging on junk food if it were dressed up like a gourmet feast ? That 's the question followers of a clever new Instagram account are asking themselves , after taking a harder look at the deceiving dishes being served up online . Appearing under a fictional name to remain anonymous , Chef Jacques LaMerde - which roughly translates to ` jack sh -- ' - the account pokes fun at high-end dining by dressing up cheap , fattening , convenience store goods to look like fancy gastronomic creations . Not only are the plates artistically manufactured , but they come with equally pretentious captions . One description , featuring a Hot Pocket as the centerpiece , read : ` Hay-baked Hot Pockets with Hidden Valley Bacon Ranch spheres and a puree of Zoodles ' Fancy that : The Instagram account Jacques LaMerde is dressing up junk food as fine dining to poke fun at high-end restaurants . Seen here is a corn dog with packet ham , Spongebob Squarepants macaroni and ketchup . I 'll have s ` more , please : This delicate assortment features generic chocolate cake ` from the freezer section ' , banana popsicle , ` Muscle Milk spheres ' and Graham cracker pastry cream . Delicious . Gourmet all the way : Here we have a cupcake with Rainbow Dunk-A-Roos , yogurt raisins , dusted with Starbucks Mocha Frappacino ` caviar ' Flavorsome : Here we have a slice of Jimmy Dean sausage with canned spring vegetas , Frito hoops and a ` palate cleansing shot of fermented Lake Michigan water with nutisional -LRB- sic -RRB- yeast rim . Looks a little different here : The dishes use cheap , everyday junk food , such as Fritos and Jimmy Dean sausage patties . Dessert time : Looks elaborate right ? It 's actually just a Pop Tart with Mike n Ike and some Mentos scattered about . Gastronomic : This creation was called ` Bugs on a stick ' and features raisins on a celery stick with Cheez Whiz and kale shreds . To see the full Instagram , visit@chefjacqueslamerde .
