A bookkeeper has been sacked after calling her boss ` a complete d *** ' in a text message - and then accidentally sending it to him . Louise Nesbitt was employed at Perth mining exploration company Dragon Mountain Gold . On January 12 last year , she mistakenly sent a text to her boss meant for her daughter 's boyfriend who was engaged as a contact plumber for the firm . A Perth office bookkeeper was fired from her job after she called her boss ` a complete d *** ' in a text message . In the message , Ms Nesbitt wrote : ` Now remember ... -LSB- her employer -RSB- Rob is a complete d *** ... we know this already so please try your best not to tell him that regardless of how much you might feel the need . ' Realising her mistake , she immediately texted her boss asking him to delete the message and ignore its contents . Ms Nesbitt sent a further message explaining the insult was a ` joke within our family ' . ` I need to explain ... that message came across so wrong , ' she said . ` That is not how I feel . My sense of humour is to exaggerate . It is not how I feel . ` Please forget it and just go on as normal . I am very very sorry . ' Ms Nesbitt - who had employed at Dragon Mountain Gold since 2004 - was fired five days after the incident , with her employer saying it was due to ` gross misconduct ' . She filed a unfair dismissal complaint with the Fair Work Commission . While she cross examined , Ms Nesbitt argued the text had been taken out of context . The commission also heard she had sent an email to her employer expressing the view she did not think he listened to her or took her counsel on board . This had been causing tension between the two before the January 12 incident . Commissioner DJ Cloghan ruled against Ms Nesbitt . ` On the evidence , I am not persuaded that when Ms Nesbitt referred to Mr Gardner as `` a complete d *** '' , it was her sense of humour to exaggerate or , that it was `` light-hearted insult '' or it should be read in the context of the person it was meant for , ' Commissioner DJ Cloghan said . ` It was far from a `` light-hearted insult '' , it was a hurtful and unpleasant appraisal of -LSB- her employer -RSB- , for whom she earned $ 95,000 per annum .
