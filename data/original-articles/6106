Salford assistant coach Ian Watson is poised to come out of his playing retirement at the age of 38 to answer an SOS from the Red Devils . Watson , whose last game was as player-coach in the Championship for Swinton last June , has stepped up his training ahead of Sunday 's home game against Castleford after Salford lost a fourth player to suspension and three more to injury . `` It 's a definite possibility that we might need to call on Ian , '' head coach Iestyn Harris said . `` He 's been training and is ready to answer the call if need be . '' Salford assistant coach Ian Watson is poised to come out of his playing retirement at the age of 38 . Salford are without Rangi Chase , Weller Hauraki , Cory Paterson and Darrell Griffin through suspension , while scrum-half Michael Dobson -LRB- knee -RRB- , centre Junior Sa'u and winger Ben Jones-Bishop -LRB- leg -RRB- were all injured in Saturday 's 22-18 Challenge Cup fifth-round defeat at Leigh , joining Josh Griffin , Tommy Lee , Jason Walton and brothers Jordan and Adam Walne on the sidelines . Salford recently signed veteran hooker Wayne Godwin on loan from Dewsbury and this week borrowed Oliver Gildart and James Greenwood from Wigan but Harris is still thought to be down to just 17 fit players . If Watson plays against the Tigers at the AJ Bell Stadium , he would become the oldest player currently in Super League , taking over from Salford 's former Leeds and Warrington forward Adrian Morley , who turns 38 next month . The record for the oldest player in Super League is held by Australian Steve Menzies , who was 39 when he ended his career at Catalans Dragons at the end of the 2013 season . Watson , who made 41 Super League appearances as a half-back with Salford in 1997 and 2002 , brought up the 500th appearance of his career in March 2014 , a total that included a record-equalling 30 caps for Wales and took in spells with Widnes , Rochdale , Oldham , Halifax and Leigh .
