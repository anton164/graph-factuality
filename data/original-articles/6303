But the biggest name likely to be in attendance at Dunblane Cathedral , where the couple are tying the knot , is one-time British tennis star Tim Henman . Indeed , when the sport 's world number one , Novak Djokovic , was asked by a journalist recently if he would be attending the celebration , he replied with a curt : ` Not invited ' , before following up with a more charitable : ` But I wish him all the best . ' As one of Murray 's fiercest rivals on the court , it 's not surprising Djokovic is n't at the top of the guest list but it seems that , unlike a lot of famous faces , the couple have taken a more low-key approach when it comes to who to invite . Murray has said : ` There wo n't be any celebrities as such . ` I do n't have any celebrity friends so it was n't something that was planned . ' -LSB- It 'll be -RSB- Everyone who we 're close to , people we 've spent a lot of time with in the past but also people we see ourselves spending time with in the future . ` That 's how we came up with the names . Pretty much everything is done now and under control . I 'm sure a few things will come up next week but it 's pretty much sorted . ' Who made the list ? British player Jamie Delgado -LRB- left -RRB- is a close friend of Murray 's but celebrity pals such as James Corden -LRB- right -RRB- , who admittedly may well have other fish to fry in the US , wo n't be attending . There will be names from the tennis world in attendance but certainly not players who are as well known as the likes of Nadal or Federer . Murray has invited Dutch doubles player Jules Rojer , who he spends time with while training in Miami and Davis Cup team mate James Ward . Another British pro Jamie Delgado will also attend . Bride-to-be Kim was spotted cheering on her fianc√© this weekend as he battled Novak Djokovic in the men 's final at the Miami Open before the couple fly back to Scotland ahead of their nuptials . For the 27-year-old 's many fans and friends in the town , it means at least part of the wedding of the year will be a spectator sport , played out on the streets of the community . It is understood local residents and businesses urged the former Wimbledon champion to hold the April 11 service at the cathedral rather than at luxury hotel Cromlix House in nearby Kinbuck -- so they too could toast his big day . The reception will be held at Cromlix , which Murray owns . There 's a friendly rivalry on court between Andy Murray and tennis world number one Novak Djokovic but the Serbian wo n't be attending Murray 's nuptials this weekend . Lady in waiting : Kim Sears watched her husband-to-be lose to Novak Djokovic in the Miami Open in Key Biscayne , Florida last weekend . Hundreds of well-wishers are expected to welcome the couple as they arrive at Dunblane Cathedral , before Andy and Kim hold their wedding reception at luxury hotel Cromlix House . The 300-seat , 12th century cathedral is much bigger than the chapel at Cromlix , which seats only 28 . Thousands are expected to line Dunblane High Street on the day . Murray 's uncle Niall Erskine said : ` I 'm sure it will be a popular decision , as he 's had so much support from the people of Dunblane in the past . Andy has admitted that , food aside , he 's left much of the preparation for the big day to his betrothed : ` Kim 's been pretty much doing it ' ` I 've tried to help out when she has asked , but I have n't been over-involved . I did all the food and cake tasting which I really enjoyed , although I did n't think I was going to . He added : ` It 's a big day for Kim . Pretty much everything is taken care of now . She seems fairly relaxed but as we get closer that might change . '
