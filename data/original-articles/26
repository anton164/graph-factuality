Ferrari and Sebastian Vettel conjured one of the biggest surprises for many a Formula One season with the team 's first victory for almost two years at the last race in Malaysia . Many people expected another dominant Mercedes campaign in the wake of last season 's crushing success and thoroughly convincing win in the opening race in Australia . Lewis Hamilton was fastest in first practice for this weekend 's Chinese Grand Prix . The Mercedes driver , who leads the championship , set the pace as he bids to win his fourth race in China . Hamilton was over half-a-second clear of Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg in opening practice . 1 . Lewis Hamilton Mercedes 1:39.033 . 2 . Nico Rosberg Mercedes 1:39.574 . 3 .

Even Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff suggested Ferrari 's success was ` a wake-up call ' to his organisation . Without doubt Mercedes responded in the first practice session ahead of the latest race at the Shanghai International Circuit , and none more so than reigning champion Hamilton . A three-times winner at this track , including last season , Hamilton finished 0.541 secs clear of team-mate Nico Rosberg , with a best lap of one minute 39.033 secs . None of their rivals even came close , with Vettel a further half a second adrift at 1:40.157 secs , with his team-mate Kimi Raikkonen 1.6 secs down on Hamilton . Valtteri Bottas was ninth in his Williams , over two seconds shy of Hamilton 's best time . Jenson Button was within three seconds of Hamilton 's lap and 13th in the first practice standings . Fresh from winning in Malaysia , Vettel was best of the rest in Shanghai behind the two Mercedes drivers . To underline Mercedes ' supremacy and the gap to Raikkonen , from the Finn in fourth to Force India 's Nico Hulkenberg in 18th , there was a difference of just 1.5 secs . Behind Mercedes and Ferrari , the best of the rest was Felipe Nasr in his Sauber , with the Brazilian rookie 1.979 secs off the pace , whilst Daniel Ricciardo finished 1.996 secs down for Red Bull . No other driver came within two seconds of Hamilton , with Daniil Kvyat seventh for Red Bull , followed by Toro Rosso 's Carlos Sainz . The Williams duo of Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa completed the top 10 , 2.27 secs adrift and split by a mere one thousandth of a second . As for McLaren , Jenson Button was 13th and Fernando Alonso 17th , with the latter 3.128 secs behind Hamilton , with even Jolyon Palmer ahead of him on his debut for Lotus . Last year 's GP2 champion , serving as reserve with Lotus this season , was 15th and 2.934 secs down , with highly-experienced team-mate Pastor Maldonado only 0.6 secs ahead . Manor pair Will Stevens and Roberto Merhi both enjoyed plenty of track time , completing 38 laps between them . For young British rookie Stevens his 18 laps were crucial as he had so far failed to take part in either qualifying session or race in Australia and Malaysia . Stevens finished 6.346 secs behind Hamilton , with Merhi bringing up the rear another 1.1 secs down .
