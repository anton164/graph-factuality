Detectives are expected to speak to Mr Norman after he was photographed with trays of baked goods on April 2 . He described the allegations as ` nonsense ' , saying : ` We had a couple of small boxes of chocolate muffins ... we may have given out one or two to children , who are not even voters . ' The probe follows would-be Ukip MP Kim Rose , who is standing in Southampton Itchen , being grilled by police for giving out sausage rolls at a party event earlier this year . The 57-year-old has criticised the ` absolutely ridiculous ' investigation after he was told he will face no further action . Mr Rose said : ` The officers told me today that I have now entered the political world and I must no longer hand out sausage rolls . ` They told me I have got to watch anything I do . So I 'm going to stay away from bakeries from now on - if I see one I 'm going to run a mile . ' Ukip candidate Kim Rose , 57 , was questioned by police after being accused of bribing voters with sausage rolls .
