The company scrapped the deal after the announcement last month of an EU cap -- due to be introduced in October -- limiting the fees retailers can be charged for processing payments . Capital One said it made perks ` no longer sustainable ' . Kevin Mountford , of price comparison website MoneySupermarket , told the Daily Telegraph : ` This is a classic case of regulators , in this case European , trying to act with the consumer in mind , only for the policy to come back to bite the very people it was supposed to help . ` Its new rules wo n't just hit cashback cards , all loyalty programmes are at risk because something will have to give when card companies are squeezed . ' Last month , the European Parliament voted in favour of a cap at 0.2 per cent of the transaction value for debit cards and 0.3 per cent for credit cards . The cap will apply to all purchases paid for with a card in the EU -- either abroad or on the internet . Several credit card companies -- including American Express , Barclaycard , and Santander -- have millions of customers who earn hundreds of pounds or free flights if they clear their debts every month . Capital One , which pays card-holders 5p for every Â£ 1 cleared , has written to customers warning that the amount they earn will be much lower from June 1 .

It said that fees paid by merchants such as shops and restaurants to accept cards are being reduced , and it was these fees which had funded their cashback . It said it would not be increasing fees or charges as a result of the changes . Rachel Springall , of financial information website Moneyfacts , said : ` The changes from Capital One could be the starting point for a change to reward schemes because of the new ruling on interchange fees . ` Instead of adding on card fees , providers will be looking at other ways to re-coup their costs and one of the ways to do this is to withdraw reward schemes or interest-free offers . All it takes is for one provider to start the ball rolling before others do the same . '
