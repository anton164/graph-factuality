Patrice Evra believes Juventus called upon quintessential Italian traits in securing their route to the Champions League semi-finals , describing the Sere A side 's defeat of Monaco as ` ugly ' . Massimiliano Allegri 's team secured a 0-0 draw at the Stade Louis II on Wednesday night , meaning they progressed 1-0 on aggregate , after Arturo Vidal 's second-half penalty proved the difference in Turin last week . Evra withstood a few nervous moments as Juventus sat back and allowed the French side to dictate the play , but after helping the Italians reach their first Champions League semi-final since 2002-03 , the former Manchester United full back claimed that Ligue 1 's elite clubs could learn from a more combative style of play . Patrice Evra prevents Monaco 's Yannick Ferreira Carrasco from delivering a cross at the Stade Louis II . Evra is put under pressure by Monaco 's Geoffrey Kondogbia during Wednesday night 's quarter-final clash . ` I 'm not scientist but for Paris Saint-Germain to lose to a big club like Barcelona and Monaco to lose to an experienced team like Juventus , but I think that in France we 're okay being the country that finishes second , ' the French defender told beIN Sports after the game . ` We 'll have to take the next step , to have a different mentality . You have to respect the opponent but be more aggressive on the pitch . ` I think the French teams sometimes doubt themselves . They play some beautiful games but when it comes down to it , do not go through . ` We must give a nod to Monaco , who deserved more tonight . But , from our point of view , we never really doubted ourselves . ` We played the Italian way - it 's solid , it 's ugly , but it works . I am happy and at the same time a little sad for Monaco . It was strange to return to Stade Louis II , where I spent many happy years . ' Injury meant Paul Pogba sat out the Monaco clash and he is likely to miss the Champions League semi-finals . Meanwhile , Evra 's has urged compatriot Paul Pogba not to be tempted into a swift comeback from injury , after the 22-year-old was ruled out of action for 50 days when he injured a hamstring in the last-16 victory over Borussia Dortmund . ` He 's hungry but he has an injury that requires attention , ' the left-back added . ` He must not rush his return and instead have faith in the medical staff . He must only return if he 's 100 per cent . '
