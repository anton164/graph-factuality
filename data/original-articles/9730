Japan 's J-League is just four games into a new season , but already the behaviour of its players is hitting the headlines for the wrong reasons after a player appeared to stamp on an opponent 's face . Videos of the South Korean defender Kim Min Hyeok , who plays for Sagan Tosu , have gone viral after he allegedly brutally stamped on the face of opponent Mu Kanazaki . Sagan are ninth in the J-League and furious claims have been made that the 23-year-old deliberately committed the horrific foul after being jostled by 11th-placed Kashima Antlers player Kanazaki . Kim Min Hyeok -LRB- left -RRB- and Mu Kanazaki -LRB- right -RRB- fight it out for the ball on the wing during a J-League clash . After Kanazaki went down , it is alleged that Hyeok stamped down on the face of his fallen opponent . Despite the vicious looking nature of Hyeok 's apparent attack and Kanazaki 's dramatic clutch to his face , the defender only received a yellow card and was allowed to play on , much to the fans ' uproar . Whether or not the foul was intentional , it is suspected that the reason for Japanese fans ' outcry is not so much the act itself , but the fact that it was committed by a South Korean player . Hyeok 's boot appears to scrape down Kanazaki 's face , but the man on the floor came out as the winner later . Hyeok was somehow only shown a yellow card for the challenge that infuriated fans at the stadium . Some Japanese fans have demanded not only the expulsion of Hyeok , but of all South Koreans , from the game . However , regardless of the controversy , justice - to some extent - was served when the supposed stamped-on player 's team won 3-1 , with Kanazaki among the goals .
