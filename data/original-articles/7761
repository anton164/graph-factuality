Boris Johnson was accused of ` breath-taking cheek ' after he set out his vision of ` moral purpose ' in business and politics . The London Mayor praised the Coalition for having kept down unemployment and not returning to the dole queues of 1980s Britain . He said the fact that more jobs were being created was ` one of the absolute moral triumphs ' of the government . Boris Johnson , who is standing to be a Tory MP in a west London constituency , has set out his vision of ` moral purpose ' in business and politics . The comments by Mr Johnson , who is standing to be a Tory MP in a west London constituency , will be seen as an attempt to position himself as a future party leader . Labour 's Stephen Pound accused the London Mayor of ` breath-taking cheek ' Last night Labour 's Stephen Pound , who is fighting to defend a nearby seat , said : ` I 'm thinking of a sentence with the words pot , kettle and black in it . ' ` It seems that Boris 's motto is `` do as I say , not as I do '' . It really is breath-taking cheek . He obviously has a different definition of `` moral '' to most of my constituents . ' In 2004 , Mr Johnson admitted a four-year affair with the journalist Petronella Wyatt while he was married to his second wife Marina , with whom he has four children . Five years later he fathered a child by Helen Macintyre , an unpaid adviser in the London Assembly . Mr Johnson spoke about morality in an interview with the London Evening Standard , saying he believed wealth creation was there to fund public services such as schools and hospitals . He said : ` I think this country was harrowed by the experience of mass unemployment in the early Eighties . ` One of the absolute moral triumphs of this Coalition government has been to get us through the worst recession for 50 years without seeing a return to those levels of unemployment .
