Jeremy Peace , the West Bromwich Albion chairman , will only sell the club to a buyer who will invest money on and off the pitch . Tony Pulis has held conversations with Peace and is adamant the chairman wants to ensure his legacy is maintained . Peace is open to selling West Brom for £ 150million as long as a suitable custodian can be found by July , and Pulis would want immediate talks with any new chairman over his position . Tony Pulis is adamant that chairman Jeremy Peace will sell the club to someone who wants to invest heavily . Peace has fielded enquiries from consortia in America , China and Australia with some parties already having a tour of the club 's training ground facilities . Pulis said : ` If he is going to sell it then he will sell it to people who want to invest in the club . That 's the main point he 's made to me . ` The fact he 's put it up for sale and everybody knows now if someone comes in and he does a deal I would imagine there will be bolt-ons to invest in the club . Peace has put the club up for sale for £ 150million but only to someone who would be a suitable owner . ` At the end of the season if they change ownership then obviously you have to sit down and speak to the people , that 's very , very relevant to me . ` But I think that Jeremy is a massive West Bromwich Albion supporter , he 's been here a long time and he 's done a lot of very , very good things for this football club , so I do n't think he wants to see his legacy blown away . ' West Brom were thrashed by fellow strugglers Queens Park Rangers at the Hawthorns last weekend .
