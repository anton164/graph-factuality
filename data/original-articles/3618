Weinstein 's camp have dismissed Miss Battilana as an opportunist with a sketchy past . It has emerged that Battilana previously told Italian authorities she witnessed a so-called ` bunga-bunga ' orgy involving disgraced Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi at his Milan mansion in 2010 .

Battilana met the wealthy car dealer in September 2009 when she was under 18 and therefore below the age of consent for prostitution in Italy , according to Italian newspaper reports . In her police statement , she said the man invited her into his car , where he then caressed ` my hand and left leg ' and proposed ` that I become his ` playmate ' , she said . Battilana said he then gave her a bag with € 2,000 , before assuring her it was only ` an advance of the € 5,000 he would give me every month ' . She added : ` Despite the indecency of the proposal , both because of my psychological subjection in which I found myself and because of the severe poverty of my family I felt forced against my will not to refuse the money . ' The relationship ended after she was accepted into the Miss Italia 2010 pageant . Prosecutors in Italy asked for the rape allegation to be dismissed in 2012 but it was not reported whether the judge granted the dismissal - although it is likely it would have been carried out .
