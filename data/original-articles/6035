A taxi driver channelled his inner Pavarotti and produced an emotionally charged opera performance to the surprise of his customers . The Uber driver was filmed by passengers as he sang along to a radio broadcast while driving in Boston , America . At first the driver lets the radio take command and Pavarotti 's distinctive voice can be heard from within side the cab . At first the driver lets the radio play before he begins singing along to the Pavarotti song in perfect tune . He then begins singing along himself -- loudly so that he is audible above the radio and the sounds of the road . While looking around as he drives , the Uber worker continues to sing along to the song both in tune and word perfectly . The song then concludes with the video maker saying : ` Wow ' and the taxi driver falling silent as the outro music plays . The passenger filming then says : ` Wow , that was brilliant . Thank you very much . ' He then asks whether the man was singing along to Pavarotti , to which the driver says yes . Reality is then restored as the passenger finishes praising the driver and instructs him to keep going straight . The passengers are amazed as they film the driver who sings along to the opera song word perfectly . Later , the film maker wrote : ` We were heading out to meet some friends at a party in South Boston and had a wonderful journey with the Uber Opera Man . ' Luciano Pavarotti was one of the most commercially successful tenors of all time and one of the Three Tenors . Gaining worldwide fame for the tone of his voice , Pavarotti made a number of televised concert performances . In 2007 , the tenor died from pancreatic cancer .
