Ryan Mason probably did n't expect his tattoo to take centre stage during his senior England debut , but that 's exactly what happened on Tuesday night . The 23-year-old was celebrating Tottenham Hotspur team-mate Andros Townsend 's equalising goal for England against Italy when a tattoo on his arm was shown across televisions worldwide . Twitter user @Danorako compared it to a photograph of himself at 12 years old , and has since been retweeted more than 20,000 times by those noticing the uncanny resemblance . Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Ryan Mason 's tattoo -LRB- left -RRB- became popular online during this celebration . Mason celebrates with Tottenham Hotspur team-mates Andros Townsend -LRB- centre -RRB- and Kyle Walker -LRB- right -RRB- . Other than that it was a relatively successful debut for the starlet . England escaped Turin with a 1-1 draw and Mason was given 16 minutes by Roy Hodgson as he replaced Jordan Henderson . Four years ago on Thursday he played just six minutes in a 1-0 defeat by Bristol City in the Championship during a loan spell with Doncaster Rovers . Mason was farmed out to Swindon Town in League One last season again , but has followed Harry Kane by making a remarkable rise to the Barclays Premier League and international football . England escaped Turin with a 1-1 draw against Italy in the friendly as they continue to build to Euro 2016 .
