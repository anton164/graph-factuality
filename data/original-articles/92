For the first time since in 100 years , Arsenal will not start the season at the summit of England 's top-flight , following the effective promotion of Bournemouth on Monday . The Cherries official name is AFC Bournemouth , meaning their name would start ahead of Arsenal 's by virtue of the alphabet when the embryonic table is compiled upon the announcement of next season 's fixtures . The Goldsands Stadium , home of AFC Bournemouth , will host Premier League football next season . Bournemouth 's promotion means Arsenal will start season in second place for the first time in 100 years . Arsenal have theoretically started each season since 1915/16 at the summit of England 's top tier , although the advent of the First World War meant it was only in 1919 that the club officially began their century-old record . The Gunners only finished fifth in the last pre-war competitive season , but they were nevertheless elected to rejoin the First Division after the First World War in 1919 -- 20 , at the expense of local rivals Tottenham . After Eddie Howe guided Bournemouth to within touching distance of the Promised Land on Monday with victory over Bolton , only a highly improbable goal-swing would deny them automatic promotion . As a result , Arsenal will begin next season second in the Premier League before a ball is kicked , behind the south coast club by a full 12 letters . Eddie Howe has remarkably guided Bournemouth to within touching distance of the Promised Land .
