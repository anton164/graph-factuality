Formula One great Jackie Stewart has bemoaned the downfall of the German Grand Prix and is urging the sport 's bosses not to forsake tradition for money as the number of European races on the calendar dwindles . The German GP was erased from the 2015 schedule because of financial problems and F1 commercial head Bernie Ecclestone could not guarantee the future of the iconic Italian Grand Prix . The race had been in doubt due to questions over which circuit would host the race , which has been shared between Hockenheim and Nurburgring in recent seasons . F1 races have started to move away from Europe towards lucrative venues in the Middle East . Nico Rosberg celebrates winning last year 's German GP , which has been scrapped from the schedule . Officials from both circuits had voiced concern that time was running out to organise the race , which was scheduled to take place over the weekend of July 17-19 . A short FIA statement said no agreement could be reached with Ecclestone , the commercial rights holder -LRB- CRH -RRB- . ` The German Grand Prix has been withdrawn as the CRH and promoter did not reach agreement , ' the statement said . The decision means the 2015 season will be shortened to 19 races , with a three-week break between the British Grand Prix on July 5 and the Hungarian Grand Prix on July 26 . Former three-time world champion Jackie Stewart wants Europe 's ` essential races ' to remain unchanged . More races are heading to Asia and the Middle East . Stewart , a three-time world champion , says there should always be a place for the ` essential ' races in Germany , Italy , Britain , France and Monaco as they helped ` motorsport to become what it is today . ' Stewart told Sportsmail that it 's ` terrific we 're going to new countries but you still have to respect your heritage . ' F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone has not been able to guarantee the future of the Italian Grand Prix .
