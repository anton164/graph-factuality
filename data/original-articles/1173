Manchester City have defended price hikes after some fans saw the cost of their season tickets almost double . A number of fans in the East Stand at the Etihad Stadium have been informed that their £ 885 season cards will rocket to £ 1,750 . But the club say that is because the seats have been upgraded and now come with a different package . Some Etihad season tickets have seen their price double , despite empty seats at times this season . Some fans will now have to pay over £ 1,700 to watch Manuel Pellegrini 's side , up from just £ 885 . They also point out that they still have 8,000 seats below Manchester United 's cheapest offering . Some of the fans affected claim City , who face a fight to secure Champions League football after winning last season 's Premier League title , are abusing their loyalty . One fan said : ` After the season we have had you would think that if anything they would be lowering the prices . ` When I was told about how much they were going up to I thought it was an error . They are taking advantage of us , despite how poor they have been this year . ' The club point out that they have reviewed pricing at the stadium following its extension , which will see the capacity rise from 48,000 to 54,000 next season . City claim the change is due to upgrades which have come in during the stadium 's expansion . City have slumped to fourth this season after some poor performances in their title defence . They also cite improvements to seating and add that a number of fans have seen a decrease in the price of their ticket . City add that they have increased the number of £ 299 season tickets available with only Stoke City offering cheaper . The club confirmed yesterday that playmaker David Silva did not suffer any fractures in Sunday 's Premier League win over West Ham . Silva was taken to hospital for checks on his cheekbone and collarbone after being caught in the face by an elbow from Hammers midfielder Cheikhou Kouyate at the Etihad Stadium .
