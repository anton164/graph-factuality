Stephan Lichtsteiner could tell Eden Hazard and Paul Pogba were going to be special after training with them , and the defender has tipped Kingsley Coman to be the next big thing . Lichtsteiner played with Hazard at Lille and currently stars alongside Pogba at Juventus , where he feels he is watching 18-year-old forward Coman being sculpted into a special player . ` Eden was there for my last year at Lille , ' Lichtsteiner told the Independent . ` In training you could just see that he was an incredible player , he had something that nobody else had .

He arrived at a club that was already winning and he worked hard , learning from -LSB- Andrea -RSB- Pirlo , -LSB- Claudio -RSB- Marchisio and -LSB- Arturo -RSB- Vidal . ' Asked if he recongises the quality Hazard and Pogba share in any other players , Lichtsteiner said : ` Players like this are not like fish in the sea , but Kingsley Coman has all the attributes to eventually be a very good striker . ' Lichtsteiner was part of the Juventus team that won 1-0 in Turin last week against Monaco in the Champions League quarter-final first leg . Only Arturo Vidal 's penalty separated the teams that Tuesday night , though Juventus just as importantly avoided conceding an away goal to their French visitors . Lichtsteiner is expected to line up against Monaco on Wednesday night in Monaco as they look to see out the tie and book their place in the semi-finals .
