Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Shaharyar Khan hopes for a series of five one-dayers as soon as May . No test playing nation has toured Pakistan due to security concerns since gunmen attacked the bus carrying Sri Lankan cricketers as they travelled to Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore in March 2009 for the third day of the second Test . Six local policemen and two civilians were killed in the attack by 12 gunmen , while seven players were injured , and Pakistan has been forced to play away games elsewhere - namely the United Arab Emirates - ever since . Khan says Lahore would host three one-day internationals against Zimbabwe while the remaining two ODIs would be played in Karachi .

English coach Paul Farbrace , then in charge of the Sri Lanka side , was also injured in the attack .
