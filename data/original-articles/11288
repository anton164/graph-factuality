Siem de Jong played 45 minutes for Newcastle Under 21s on his comeback from a collapsed lung . The 26-year-old made way at the break after coming through the first half of United 's 2-0 defeat to Derby County at St James ' Park . De Jong has made just one Premier League start since his Â£ 6million arrival from Ajax last summer . Newcastle midfielder Siem de Jong played 45 minutes for Peter Beardsley 's Under 21 side on Wednesday . Farrend Rawson -LRB- third from right -RRB- is congratulated by his team-mates after scoring at St James ' Park . He tore his thigh muscle in September and was days away from returning in February when , for the second time in two years , he suffered a collapsed lung and underwent surgery . De Jong was expected to miss the remainder of the season but now has an outside chance of featuring in the final six matches . However , on the evidence of a subdued half against the Rams , Sunday 's visit of Spurs will almost certainly come too soon . Newcastle striker Adam Armstrong -LRB- right -RRB- is pulled back by Derby 's Max Lowe . Armstrong -LRB- left -RRB- heads a cross towards Derby 's goal but his effort flies wide of the post . Meanwhile , forgotten man Facundo Ferreyra replaced De Jong at the break . The 24-year-old Argentinian striker arrived on a season-long loan from Shakhtar Donetsk last summer but is yet to make his senior debut having been plagued by a string of injuries . Derby 's victory arrived courtesy of second-half goals from Alefe Santos and Farrend Rawson .
