It has long been a highlight of the racing calender - and the ladies of Liverpool certainly did n't disappoint with fashion and drunken frolics once again taking centre stage . Trotting into Aintree in a collection of floral , flamboyant and eye-catching numbers , thousands of female race-goers displayed their indomitable spirit for the occasion . Clearly taking the ` Chanel-inspired ' style guide to heart , many opted for outfits that would n't have been out of place at a wedding - whether as part of the bridal party or as the bride herself . Others seemed to have taken heed of the sunshine and instead sported full-skirted looks bedecked with blooms in pastel shades of lemon , periwinkle and peach . Most , however , were intent on nothing more than enjoying the blissful weather with many opening proceedings with a mini bottle of champagne , quaffed with the help of a booze funnel . The occasion may have commenced with glamorous group photos and sunny selfies but as Ladies ' Day rolled on , the hours of drinking appeared to take their toll , not only on the female race fans but their outfits as well . Wardrobe malfunctions hit many a low-cut dress and thigh-length frock and some even chose to flash their bottom for photographers , while others struggled to keep their composure on a wooden racehorse . As the mid-afternoon sun beamed over Aintree , balancing in high heels and platforms presented more of a challenge and race-goers were seen staggering around the grounds . It was n't just the ladies who were making the most of the occasion . Aintree 's gentlemen were also out in full force , with one group donning a particularly garish selection of suits .
