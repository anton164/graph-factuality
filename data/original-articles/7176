A hospital in Western Australia is in hot water after blood and bone fragments were found on supposedly sanitised medical instruments . The $ 2 billion Fiona Stanley Hospital in southwest Perth was stripped of its medical service provider Serco after they failed to return sterilising equipment by an arranged date in February . The company was fined $ 60,000 and was subject to Department of Health workers auditing its staff , but the hospital has been found of continuing to operate with poorly sanitised instruments , reports ABC . The $ 2 billion Fiona Stanley Hospital in southwest Perth was found to have blood and bone fragments of some its medical instruments . Australian Medical Association WA president Michael Gannon said some of the instruments were found to contain blood and human matter . ` There 's been reports of bits of bone on some orthopaedic equipment , there 's been reports , that are really hard to believe , of blood still being seen on some instruments , ' he said . ` So this gives us great concerns . We 've been told the problem 's been fixed and this would suggest that it has n't . Dr Gannon said the latest revelations will further damage the hospitals public image , generating a loss of morale within its workforce . ` I ca n't imagine how people must feel if they 've got surgery booked at the hospital at some stage , ' he said . The hospital was stripped of its medical service provider Serco after they failed to return sterilising equipment by an arranged date in February .
