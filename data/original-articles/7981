This may just be the best photo-bomb ever . An adorable green sea turtle made quite the unexpected appearance in tourist Diovani de Jesus 's group photo . ` We were posing at Apo Island when this sea turtle surfaced to breathe and photo-bombed , ' de Jesus wrote on his blog . An adorable green sea turtle pulled off the ultimate photo-bomb , crashing this group photo in the Philippines . The shallow water in Apo Island , Negros Oriental , Philippines is a feeding ground for sea turtles , so spottings are n't uncommon . However , it is rare that one of the endangered animals would come so close - or look so intently into the camera . Posting the photo on Earth Day , de Jesus adds : ` Just like what my friend Genesis said , this is a reminder that humans and creatures like this gentle pawikan can co-exist . ' This particular island is one of the world 's best known community-managed marine protected areas . The turtles are traditionally found in tropical and subtropical waters , travelling long distances between feeding areas and the beaches where they are hatched . Traveller Diovani de Jesus posted the hilarious photo on Earth Day as a reminder that we can all co-exist .
