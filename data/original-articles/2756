An investigation has been launched at a £ 33,000-a-year school after students were taught the wrong exam text . Students at Wellington College , in Berkshire , spent the last year studying a different classic book for their imminent AS-level exam . The mistake only came to light when mock papers arrived and no exam questions related to the taught text . Prestigious : A spokeswoman for the school , which charges £ 33,000-a-year , said parents had been satisfied by the prompt actions of the school after staff discovered they had been teaching the wrong English text . Now pupils will have to cram their studying into just a few weeks with extra lessons put in place by the school . Sources close to the school , which proudly boasts to be the Best Public School in the Tatler Schools Guide 2014 on its website , said students were left devastated by the blunder . The mistake is believed to have occurred when a teacher changed a text on a spreadsheet without notifying other staff . According to The Sun , the college , whose alumni includes Will Young , Rory Bremner and Made in Chelsea 's Caggie Dunlop , apologised for the error but would not name the works of literature involved . Stumped : Students at the posh school are said to be upset by the blunder which has seen nearly a year of hard work go to waste -LRB- file photo -RRB- .

Wellington College is sorry this mistake happened . '
