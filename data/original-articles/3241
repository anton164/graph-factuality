It 's no secret that almost all dogs love water , but very few are making waves like these two border collies . One-year-old Anna and six-year-old Indi have been thrilling crowds at surfing competitions for dogs after taking to the sport like a duck to water . With the help of their owner , Zane Jones , the four-legged surfers use their low centre of gravity to keep them stable while hanging ten off the coast of Queensland , Australia . Anna and Indi , owned by 32-year-old Zane Jones , have been surfing since they were about 10 weeks old . Zane , a 32-year-old search and rescue crewman , said : ` I have been surfing for around 16 years , but when we got Indi , I suddenly had a new riding partner . ` She would perch on the front of the board and as we caught the waves occasionally lifting one paw up as if she was hanging five , which is Indi 's famous trade mark . ` Anna was exactly the same , they both loved the water from the very first day we took them to the beach . ' Zane and his partner , Caitlin Ollier , 26 , have owned the dogs , who both began surfing when they were just 10 weeks old , since they were puppies . Indi , who won a runners-up medal at a competition , has been trained to lift her paw to ` hang five ' The dogs use their low centre of gravity to keep them stable while surfing in Queensland , Australia . The dogs have n't won a competition yet , but their owners are hoping they can top their best result to date -- a runners-up medal for Indi and the Noosa Festival of Surfing . Zane said : ` Both girls are naturals when it comes to balance and knowing where to stand on the board . ` When I take Indi and Anna out on the waves at our local surfing spot we always draw a big crowd of people who watch from the board walk or the beach . ` We even get stopped when we go for walks as people are starting to recognise the girls . ` Hopefully we can improve our competition performance in the future , but the girls are getting better every day .
