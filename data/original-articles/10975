Manchester United and Liverpool target Â£ 25million Memphis Depay has held talks with Paris St Germain this week with the permission of his club PSV Eindhoven . The dialogue between PSG and Depay represents a threat to the Premier League clubs with the Qatari-backed French club understood to have made a significantly better financial offer than Liverpool . United have yet to hold detailed talks with the player but have informed PSV of their wish to do so while Liverpool have established a good relationship with the club and would be serious contenders to sign the wide player if United 's offer does not match their own . Memphis Depay -LRB- centre -RRB- has held talks with PSG , despite Liverpool and Manchester United 's interest . Holland player Depay -LRB- right -RRB- has caught the eye of clubs over Europe with good form for club and country . Louis van Gaal gave Depay his international debut but could miss out on bringing him to Old Trafford . However , Depay is intrigued by the prospect of playing with Zlatan Ibrahimovic and is good friends with Gregory van der Wiel , his team-mate in the Holland national team , who is also at PSG . With Bayern Munich also considering a move for the winger , a move to the Premier League is in the balance though if United firm up their interest , they clearly have an advantage . Louis van Gaal gave Depay his international debut for Holland and the player also worked under van Gaal 's assistant , Albert Stuivenberg in the Holland Under-17 team which won the 2011 European Championships .
