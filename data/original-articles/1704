Many rejoiced yesterday as Hillary Clinton finally announced her long-awaited campaign to be President of the United States , marking the start of her fight ` to earn your vote ' . But this political operator was less than impressed with the news , bursting into tears and complaining that the former First Lady and Secretary of State had stolen his thunder . Zeke Celello , who appears to be around two years old , was overcome with emotion when Clinton declared her second presidential bid , and insisted to his mother that 2016 is his year to shine . Devastated : Zeke Celello burst into tears when Hillary Clinton announced that she was running . More experience : Clinton , 67 , pictured above declaring her intention to run , has better Washington connections than Zeke . The video , uploaded by his mother Erin to Facebook in the wake of the announcement , sees the would-be candidate repeatedly state his ambition to ascend to the nation 's highest office so he could ` play ... with toys ' . He eventually concedes that playtime is not the top priority of a Commander-in-Chief , but is still adamant that he is up to the task . Unfortunately , Zeke appears not to have realized that the U.S. Constitution prohibits anybody from holding the presidency until they are 35 . However , unperturbed , he eventually takes his mother 's advice and decides to run for presidency anyway . Zeke admittedly lacks the campaigning experience of Clinton , who already has to her name a period as Secretary of State , a spell in the U.S. Senate and eight years as First Lady . But he does have the advantage of youth over 67-year-old Clinton , and , unlike his more experienced rival , will not be perceived as a political insider . Accepting Ms Celello 's campaign advice , he repeats : ` I 'm Zeke and I 'm running for president . ' While he has yet to articulate a policy platform , the youngster is clearly not short on ambition .
