Leroy Fer is set to be rushed back from a knee injury to give Queens Park Rangers a boost in the relegation fight . Fer is back in training and manager Chris Ramsey hopes to have him in the squad for Saturday 's London derby at home to West Ham . The 25-year-old Dutch midfielder has not appeared since he damaged medial ligaments in his knee during in a 2-0 win at Sunderland in mid-February , when he opened the scoring . Leroy Fer could be rushed back after injuring his knee against Sunderland back in February . The Dutch midfielder has struggled for form and fitness since arriving from Norwich in the summer . ` He is in contention , ' said Ramsey . ` He 's not where we want him to be but we ca n't put him too much in cotton wool and you sometimes need to take a chance on someone . ` We 're trying to get that balance between fitness and a recurring injury . He has n't put his hand up fully but he said last week this was a target for him but we 're going to try our best to make sure he 's at least on the bench . ' QPR manager Chris Ramsey admits the club are taking a chance on Fer in bid to beat relegation . Rangers have several players returning to fitness , including defender Richard Dunne -LRB- right -RRB- . Centre-half Richard Dunne returned as a late substitute in QPR 's last game , against Chelsea , after more than two months out with a similar injury . Korean left-back Yun Suk-Young is also back after three weeks out following a head injury but Rio Ferdinand is still among those unavailable .
