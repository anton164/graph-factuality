' The detective added : ` We are hopeful that the woman shown being followed , who we have not yet identified , will come forward as a result of this new appeal . ` Although we are now seven weeks into this investi gation , our resolve to catch this man remains as strong as it was on day one . ` We are continuing to conduct a very wide range of enquiries to identify him and would urge anyone who thinks they know who it might be to contact us immediately . ' A reward of Â£ 5,000 is offered for any information that leads to the rapist 's arrest and conviction . Anyone with any information is urged to immediately contact West Yorkshire Police .
